0, Adam Bandt says Greens could support key Labor climate policy if fossil fuels developments paused The Greens say they could support the Albanese government s changes to the safeguard mechanism a key climate policy if it agreed to pause new fossil fuel developments until the parliament has dealt with planned changes to national environment laws The Greens leader Adam Bandt said he could be open to other ways of dealing with coal and gas other than the outright ban it has proposed including a suggestion by the Climate Council that the government halt approvals until reform of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation EPBC Act is worked through later this year The minor party is pushing for the EPBC Act to include a climate trigger which would for the first time require the environment minister to consider the climate impact of a major development during the approval process The environment minister Tanya Plibersek has not supported a climate trigger but Labor has backed one in the past The prime minister Anthony Albanese introduced an unsuccessful climate trigger bill while opposition environment spokesperson in 2005 Speaking on Guardian Australia s Australian Politics podcast Bandt raised the Climate Council proposal and said the Greens were happy to also look at other suggestions as long as they dealt with the desire to keep opening up coal and gas mines and also the fact that pollution from coal and gas grows under the government scheme potentially We would look at all those suggestions that are put on the table and we would consider them in good faith he said From our perspective what we re saying is we ve got to deal with this question of opening up new coal and gas mines because that s not only untenable and is going to put a safer climate out of reach but it s even going to make meeting the government s own targets more difficult Sign up for Guardian Australia s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The Greens have introduced a bill for a climate trigger that would block developments that emit more than 100 000 tonnes of CO2 a year Other models have been proposed that would require the environment minister to consider the climate impact of a proposal but give them greater discretion over how it was dealt with Plibersek has said that companies will need to include emissions forecasts in development applications under her changes but has not endorsed a trigger The climate change minister Chris Bowen and Bandt have committed to negotiating over the safeguard mechanism which as proposed would put a new emissions intensity limit on 215 big polluting industrial sites and require most companies to make a 4 9 cut each year The government is also negotiating with the independent senator David Pocock Critics of the scheme from a climate perspective have objected to the government allowing companies to open new fossil fuel projects and buy an unlimited number of carbon credits created through contentious forest regeneration and other projects to meet emissions limits Industrial companies and lobby groups have supported the scheme in principal but some have argued for special treatment The government was criticised at a senate inquiry this week for refusing to release its analysis forecasting how the scheme would operate including the extent to which polluters would make onsite cuts and rely on offsets Bowen said the analysis was cabinet in confidence Asked about other potential points of agreement with the government including introducing a total cap on emissions from the scheme imposing more onerous requirements on new entrants and waiting for a promised overhaul of the the carbon credit scheme to be fully implemented Bandt said he didn t want to run those negotiations in public If we end up with a scheme where pollution from coal and gas goes down rather than up as is the trajectory at the moment then that broadly is where we want to get to because what s driving the problem is coal and gas And so those ideas about having a cap or what you do about new projects that come into the scheme are obviously ways of addressing what might happen to coal and gas he said The starting point is a question about whether the government agrees it wants pollution from coal and gas to go up or down More than 100 scientists and policy experts including Nobel laureate Prof Peter Doherty former Australian of the year Prof Fiona Stanley and Climate Change Authority member Prof Lesley Hughes this week signed an open letter calling on the government to not allow new fossil fuel projects as the world was on the precipice of irreversible catastrophic climate change The government is proposing to change the safeguard through both legislation and regulation The former will turn it into an emissions trading scheme as also proposed by the previous Coalition government It wants the revamped scheme which it says is central to meeting the national 2030 emissions target of a 43 cut compared with 2005 levels to start on 1 July The senate inquiry into the safeguard is due to report back on Monday  Greens leader says party will negotiate in good faith on proposals that deal with the untenable opening of new coal and gas mines, 10.0, 8.0

5, CPAC Nikki Haley calls out Republicans failure to win voters confidence as it happened At the Conservative Political Action Conference today Republicans who are not Donald Trump tried their best to convince the audience to give them a shot in 2024 Up first was his former UN ambassador Nikki Haley who argued that the GOP s struggle to win the popular vote in recent elections is a sign the party needs a change at the top Mike Pompeo Trump s former secretary of state who may also launch a presidential campaign made much the same argument But several Republicans in attendance weren t impressed Indeed the best received speech of the day was made by Steve Bannon who spent 15 minutes singing Trump s praises and condemning those who oppose him most vociferously Fox News Here s a recap of the day s events A call to defund the police was a surprise applause line at CPAC Rightwing congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene wants to make providing gender affirming care to minors a felony and believes Trump will win the GOP nomination next year Democrats remain behind Joe Biden if the statements of House lawmakers are any indication The White House condemned Tennessee s moves to crack down on drag shows in the state A big winner at CPAC this year was Newsmax Fox News fringey competitor CPAC s interests don t stop at America s borders Among the speakers today was Nigel Farage who is a familiar face at these conventions Like many who came before him today the former leader of the Brexit party used his speech to attack the transgender rights movement citing the resignation of Scottish National party leader Nicola Sturgeon Here s what he said from the Guardian s David Smith Steve Bannon just got off stage after an enthusiastic 15 minute defense of Donald Trump that was the best received speech of the day Bannon a former White House adviser who is appealing a federal prison sentence for ignoring a subpoena from the January 6 committee won more applause than any speaker before him by singing the former president s praises and attacking Fox News for ignoring Trump Donald J Trump let me repeat in a very volatile time in American history it was four years of peace and prosperity he said to loud applause You know why He puts you in the room to make decisions And that s why they hate him Bannon continued They don t hate him because he s Trump They hate him because he represents you He then attacked Fox News for not giving the former president enough coverage Note to Fox senior management when Donald J Trump talks it s newsworthy Bannon declared Maga Maga Maga Remember Murdoch you deem Trump s not going to be president well we deem that you re not going to have a network Bannon declared as he wrapped up his speech Conservatives at CPAC today heard from one Republican presidential contender Nikki Haley and another potential contender Mike Pompeo But the convention remains very much Donald Trump s show I m still sticking with Trump said Gary Wolcott a 69 year old retiree from the Virginia suburbs near Washington DC He acknowledged that Haley s speech was definitely impressive and Pompeo s too But neither dissuaded him from the support he s maintained for Trump since his first days as a candidate in 2015 I just believe he s the person who is most for America and he gave up a lot to run for president He s not a career politician and I know he s always going to try to do what he thinks is best for America Wolcott said Karen and Donald Ruthig s sentiments were much the same He gets things done Karen 77 said of Trump As for the other candidates Maybe they re wanting to run for vice I don t know but I don t think they can make it as president Her husband Donald called Pompeo s speech fabulous but Haley s predictable He didn t think either could win I don t think Nikki Haley is electable I don t think Mike Pompeo is electable and I m not even sure that Ron DeSantis is at this point he said referring to the Florida governor who is seen as probably the second strongest contender to Trump among Republicans Donald a 73 year old who was attending the convention along with his wife from Virginia s rural eastern shore worried that if the GOP nominates anyone but Trump many voters will stay home Without Trump s complete base we haven t got a prayer he said So while there may be some very good candidates in the field the electability issue makes him front and center As enduring as his support was for Trump Wolcott called on the former president to change tactics as he navigates his second GOP primary His liability is he s got to stop bashing Republicans He needs to explain why he s good not why they re bad So long as he can do that he will easily win the presidency I m not sure he can do it he said The White House this afternoon decried Tennessee s aggressive move to limit drag shows in the state The state s Republican governor Bill Lee yesterday signed a bill passed by the legislature that restricts public drag show performances the first state to do that this year CNN reported The law limits adult cabaret performances on public property defining such as a show that features topless dancers go go dancers exotic dancers strippers male or female impersonators who provide entertainment that appeals to a prurient interest or similar entertainers At the White House press briefing on Friday afternoon White House press secretary Karine Jean Pierre said American people are focussed on so many issues the economy healthcare safety in schools and lamented Republicans targeting activities like drag shows as their priority instead Going after drag shows how is that going to help people s lives she asked KJP is the first out gay White House press secretary She added that these ridiculous policies are dangerous They vilify our fellow Americans at a time when LGBTQ Americans are facing heightened violence Joe Biden has the backs of LGBTQ Americans she noted and will continue to be there for the community Earlier this month famous Tennessee drag queens including Eureka and Jaidynn Diore Fierce spoke up to Entertainment Weekly with Eureka calling the bill blatantly unconstitutional They talked to a competitor on this season s Ru Paul s Drag Race and now fellow Tennessean Aura Mayari who said she was deeply upset and saddened by the push and said the law was nothing more than a mask used to hide discrimination toward the LGBTQ community and the desire to erase drag This feels like the year when CPAC s centre of gravity shifted from Fox News to Newsmax more extreme more fringey and less relevant Fox News personnel are thin on the ground as the network embroiled in crisis over its part in pushing Donald Trump s false claims of election fraud tilts away from him towards rival Ron DeSantis Meanwhile Chris Ruddy chief executive of Newsmax was fawningly interviewed on stage by CPAC co organiser Mercedes Schlapp Adverts for Newsmax are running regularly on screens here CPAC is teeming with Trump loyalists Donald Trump Jr Steve Bannon Mike Lindell and Sebastian Gorka are causing crowd congestion as the live stream and podcast loudly cluster outside the main ballroom Such scenes might symbolise how Trump has lost Fox News but dominates the likes of Newsmax One America News Network and far right social media Fox no longer carries his rallies live whereas those channels do with smaller audiences It could be good news for DeSantis a regular on Fox as he seeks to command the Republican base and banish Trump to the margins Here are some more bits and pieces from Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene s interaction with reporters at CPAC She called on everyone in the Republican party to support the eventual nominee for president in 2024 something that former president Donald Trump seems unlikely to do But Greene confirmed that she is endorsing Trump saying she talks to him every week and I absolutely adore him The Guardian asked Would you be his running mate Greene replied We haven t really engaged That s up to President Trump who he chooses Questioned about her message to former ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley and other potential candidates she added Well it s nice that they re running but they re not going to win President Trump is going to be the primary I don t know what they re doing it for in the first place And Greene said of Ron DeSantis I think he is a fantastic governor for the state of Florida and at the snail s pace things get done here in Washington if I were Florida I d give him a third term and beg him to stay as governor Rightwing congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene just held an impromptu question and answer session with a group of reporters at CPAC who therefore paid little attention to Kimberly Guilfoyle s speech from the nearby stage The Guardian asked the first couple of questions Greene an influential figure in the House of Representative said I think the US should be pushing for peace in Ukraine instead of funding and continuing a war that seems to be escalating and putting the entire world at risk of world war three The Republican from Georgia called for US funding to cease immediately Look I voted for the resolution to support the Ukrainian people and against what Russia has done invading their country But what the United States is doing is we are actually accelerating a war there and this war should be over We should be promoting peace Europe should have peace and the United States should do their part Ukraine is not a Nato member nation and Joe Biden said in the beginning he would not defend Ukraine because they re not a Nato member nation It doesn t make sense and the American people do not support it Later Greene added that Biden is more interested in Ukraine s border than America s own or the victims of a toxic rail disaster in East Palestine Ohio She also floated an unfounded conspiracy theory that Biden s son Hunter s business dealings in Ukraine is likely underpinning the president s motivations there Does that play a role in Joe Biden s commitment to Zelenskiy as if Zelinskiy and Ukraine is the 51st state of the United States of America Is that why we re all going to be dragged into World War three And I m sorry I m not going on that train and most Americans pretty much everyone I talk to is not interested in that either In the final days of the Trump administration after he had lost the 2020 election then secretary of state Mike Pompeo declared that there will be a smooth transition to a second Trump administration Pompeo seems to have acknowledged reality in the years since and stated the grim truth about the GOP s recent election record in his speech at CPAC today Here s a clip He later appeared to throw some shade at his former boss Still no word yet from Pompeo on whether he plans to run for the GOP nomination next year At the Conservative Political Action Conference today Republicans who are not Donald Trump are trying their best to convince the audience to give them a shot in 2024 Up first was his former UN ambassador Nikki Haley who argued that the GOP s struggle to win the popular vote in recent elections is a sign the party needs a change in leadership And then she walked out of the speech venue to crowds of conservatives chanting Trump Trump Trump That s how it goes when you re not on his side at a conference were Maga rules supreme We ll see if candidate Vivek Ramaswamy or Mike Pompeo who hasn t announced a run for president yet but is seen as a potential candidate have better luck with the crowd Here s a recap of the day s events A call to defund the police was a surprise applause line at CPAC Rightwing congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene wants to make providing gender affirming care to minors a felony Democrats remain behind Joe Biden if the statements of House lawmakers are any indication CPAC is a tough place for Republicans who are not on Donald Trump s side Following her speech Nikki Haley stepped outside the venue to greet conservative attendees who made their preference for next year s GOP presidential nomination clear as this video from Bloomberg News shows The parade of speeches by former Trump officials continues with Mike Pompeo who served as secretary of state from 2018 to 2021 He s thought to be considering a run for the White House next year but hasn t yet said one way or the other Let s hear what he has to say Nikki Haley has a tall order in overcoming the former president s popularity among Republicans The latest polls have shown her support well below that of Trump s Here s one from Yahoo News YouGov which shows Trump in the lead with 45 support against Haley s 4 Haley who served as Trump s ambassador to the United Nations is surely aware of where she would end up if the Republican primary were held today As she closed out her speech she appealed to the audience to consider an alternative to the former president We ve lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections Our cause is right but we have failed to win the confidence of a majority of Americans That ends now If you re tired of losing then put your trust in a new generation And if you want to win not just as a party but as a country then stand with me Haley said Nikki Haley is now on stage at CPAC and started her stump speech off by reiterating her call for politicians over the age of 75 to take a mental competency test When I launched my campaign I said every politician over 75 years old should be required to take a mental competency test Have you seen DC lately We should start with Joe Biden and we shouldn t stop there she said The last part seemed to stir a murmur of disapproval from the audience considering that Donald Trump is 76 and would also be subject to one of these tests Many seats noticeably empty At their retreat in Baltimore this week House Democrats voiced enthusiasm about Joe Biden s likely reelection campaign with the president expected to formally announce his 2024 bid in the next several weeks I think he will win I think he s our strongest candidate congressman Pete Aguilar the House Democratic caucus chair said Thursday at an event with Punchbowl News Aguilar added I think that he can and should run and he s going to have the support of the House Democratic caucus Even House progressives who have previously clashed with Biden over policy concerns appear to be rallying behind the president Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus said Thursday that she hopes Biden will announce his reelection campaign sooner rather than later Nobody is surprised that Biden was not my choice in the first election for the primary Jayapal said But the CPC and the President and his administration have formed an incredibly strong partnership The mayor of a Maryland city has resigned after authorities arrested him on charges of possessing and distributing images of child sexual abuse according to multiple reports Patrick Wojahn 47 had been the mayor of College Park since 2015 and before that a member of the city council there for eight years when he was arrested Thursday He had submitted his resignation later the previous night as the local news outlet WBAL reported but that did little to head off the scandal that his arrest ignited drawing headlines nationally Charging documents cited by the local news station WTOP accused Wojahn of using an anonymous account to upload child abuse imagery to the mobile messaging application Kik in January Kik officials then alerted the federal missing and exploited children center which prompted police to subpoena internet service providers records that linked the uploads to Wojahn Local county investigators searched Wojahn s home in February and they seized cell phones a tablet a computer and a storage device before Thursday s arrest Wojahn faces 40 counts of possessing child abuse imagery and 16 of distributing it College Park has a population of about 35 000 and is just northeast of Washington DC Perhaps unsurprisingly Wojahn s arrest shocked the city s residents Local resident Drake Allen said he feared the scandal showed that College Park was headed in the wrong direction I don t know if this is going to wake anybody up It should but it probably won t Allen said before describing how he wishes Wojahn s successor is just a regular mayor who does his job On stage at CPAC now is Donald Trump Jr who came bearing gifts There s a little surprise for all of you he told the audience Check under your seats If there happens to be a gold chocolate bar underneath there that s a VIP ticket to my father s reception tomorrow at CPAC the former president s son said Wonder what Roald Dahl would think of that Politico has the scoop on a policy proposal of sorts from Donald Trump in his run for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 The former president who of course made his name in real estate wants to hold a contest to design and build up to 10 new Freedom Cities built from the ground up on federal land He is also proposing an investment in the development of vertical takeoff and landing vehicles the creation of hives of industry sparked by cutting off imports from China and a population surge sparked by baby bonuses to encourage would be parents to get on with procreation It is all his team says part of a larger nationwide beautification campaign meant to inspire forward looking visions of America s future Naturally the man whose recycled slogan is Make America Great Again heralds the futuristic policy by looking back in part regarding the building of the US highway system to the 1950s his happy place and of course to his own four years in the White House He says Past generations of Americans pursued big dreams and daring projects that once seemed absolutely impossible They pushed across an unsettled continent and built new cities in the wild frontier They transformed American life with the interstate highway system magnificent it was And they launched a vast network of satellites into orbit all around the earth But today our country has lost its boldness Under my leadership we will get it back in a very big way If you look at just three years ago what we were doing was unthinkable how good it was how great it was for our country Our objective will be a quantum leap in the American standard of living There s quite a lot more It s rather odd Politico also says Trump is expected to talk about policy proposals at CPAC on Saturday Stepping away from CPAC for a moment the Guardian s Michael Sainato reports that leaked audio indicates a lax approach to faulty bearings at major freight rail companies the very component that failed on the train that derailed in East Palestine Ohio and spilled toxic chemicals In leaked audio heard by the Guardian a manager for one of the US s largest rail companies can be heard explaining to a former carman that they should stop tagging railcars for broken bearings The manager says doing so delays other cargo The disclosure comes as federal agencies investigate the derailment in East Palestine Ohio A wheel bearing failure was cited as the cause of the crash in a preliminary report released by the National Transportation Safety Board In late 2016 Stephanie Griffin a former Union Pacific carman went to her manager with concerns that she was getting pushback for tagging or reporting for repair railcars Her manager told her it was OK to skip inspections Griffin asked if the manager could put that in writing That s weird said the manager We have 56 other people who are not bad ordering stuff out there You re definitely not going to get in trouble for it Griffin said He refused to bad order mark for repair cars for bad wheel bearings My boss took issue with it because it increased our dwell time When that happened corporate offices would start berating management to release the cars Dwell time refers to the time a train spends at a scheduled stop without moving It s very obvious that management is not concerned with public safety and only concerned with making their numbers look good Griffin said Griffin also claimed she and other workers did not receive any formal training to inspect and repair railcars and were left to learn from an older worker and figure the rest out from American Association of Railroads and Federal Railroad Administration handbooks Griffin suggested all major railroad carriers operate similarly The former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele possibly spoke for quite a few Americans on Thursday night when he told the Republican Georgia congresswoman and far right standard bearer Marjorie Taylor Greene to just shut the hell up about a national divorce She has no clue what the hell she s talking about Steele told MSNBC Why do we listen to this crazy fool Marjorie Taylor Greene please just shut the hell up Do us all a favor You are an embarrassment to the Republican party and to the country as a congresswoman Greene a determined conspiracy theorist and bomb thrower nonetheless newly powerful in the House GOP has been advocating a divorce between red Republican and blue Democratic states We fought that war Steele said referring to the civil war between 1861 and 1865 which ended with the assassination of the president who won it Abraham Lincoln A Republican president lost his life over trying to save the union and this fool wants to split it So here we go This is the kind of crazy that requires a lot of heavy thinking because she isn t Greene has said she is not advocating civil war a prospect some observers fear she is nonetheless bringing uncomfortably close The Guardian recommends the work of one such observer Barbara F Walter seen here discussing how it hurts to be told she looks like Greene and here discussing her recent book How Civil Wars Start This is a convention of conservatives so you shouldn t be surprised to hear calls for smaller government Usually such rhetoric centers around deregulation and cutting taxes But congressman Matt Gaetz wants to get rid of much of Washington s law enforcement capabilities Seems every time I turn around they re engaged in surveillance or list building or monitoring and I don t care if it takes every second of our time and every ounce of our energy we either get this government back on our side or we defund and get rid of abolish the FBI CDC ATF and justice department Gaetz said to applause Welcome to the defund the police club congressman Now on stage is Matt Gaetz a far right Republican congressman who you may remember because he just was cleared by the justice department of involvement in sex trafficking I think vindication looks pretty good on me the Florida lawmaker said as he kicked off his remarks Another reason to know Gaetz he was a leader of the group of Republicans who refused to elect Kevin McCarthy speaker of the House until he made concessions leading to the unprecedented delay in the new chamber s GOP majority beginning its work Rightwing congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene just spoke at CPAC where she railed against familiar targets of conservative ire such as transgender people and America s support for Ukraine But she also made a bit of news she plans to reintroduce legislation to make providing gender affirming care to minors a felony Last Congress I did something radical and extreme and remember Marjorie Taylor Greene she s so extreme she said The obviously sarcastic remark drew applause I introduced a bill called the Protect Children s Innocence Act It couldn t pass last Congress because like I said Nancy Pelosi was the speaker of the House and she doesn t believe in gender at all Greene said which is a little hard to believe if you have ever heard the Democratic former House speaker talk But we have a new speaker in our Republican majority in the House of Representatives and I m going to be introducing my bill the Protect Children s Innocence Act that will make it a felony to perform anything to do with gender affirming care The crowd erupted in applause Greene first introduced the legislation in the last Congress when Democrats controlled the House and Senate but it never went anywhere The incipient Republican civil war between Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis heated up a little today with news of how the former president reportedly plans to attack the Florida governor in the presidential primary Axios reported that Trump plans to attack Ron DeSanctimonious as he delights in branding the governor in areas including perceived disloyalty support for changes to Social Security and Medicare and his response to the Covid pandemic Trump recently denied road testing another nickname Meatball Ron though he conveniently repeated it in his denial DeSantis did not comment on the Axios report Axios pointed out that earlier this week the governor told Fox News he saw Trump s attacks as background noise Trump and the former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley are the only major declared candidates for the Republican nomination in 2024 DeSantis is among others expected to run Trump and DeSantis dominate polling though Trump has recently enjoyed a boost Polls have also shown Haley and DeSantis splitting anti Trump support giving Trump the win Axios said Trump would focus on votes DeSantis cast as a congressman to raise the eligibility aid for Medicare In a related attack line Trump reportedly wants to link DeSantis to Paul Ryan the former vice presidential nominee and House speaker now on the board at Fox and a regular Trump target Covid Axios said is a top Trump target even though the governor is known for resisting mask mandates Trump plans to attack DeSantis caution in the earliest days of the pandemic and try to fight the issue to a draw On a similarly muddy issue Trump reportedly wants to portray DeSantis as wishy washy on the war in Ukraine while he himself toes the MAGA line of cutting aid Finally Axios said Trump planned to attack DeSantis for perceived disloyalty after Trump supported his first bid for governor in 2018 and likability Speaking to Fox News this week DeSantis said Trump used to say how great of a governor I was And then I win a big victory in the 2022 midterms and all of a sudden he had different opinions And so you could take that for what it s worth Donald Trump may be beloved at CPAC but he s apparently been banned by Fox News That s what the Guardian s Ed Pilkington reports Fox News has imposed a soft ban on Donald Trump appearing on the channel his inner circle is reportedly complaining even as the broadcaster extends a warm invitation to other Republican hopefuls in next year s presidential election The news startup Semafor reports that the cooling of relations between the former president and his once beloved cable news channel has gone so far that a soft ban or silent ban is now holding Trump at arm s length The former US president has not made a weekday showing on Fox News since he chatted with his closest friend among the network s star hosts Sean Hannity in September Meanwhile Trump s rivals for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination are currently frequent guests on Fox Media Matters for America a watchdog that keeps a close eye on the network s output has counted seven weekday appearances by the former governor of South Carolina Nikki Haley since she launched her presidential bid last month Even the lesser known right wing activist and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy who threw his hat into the ring last week has appeared four times on Fox Florida s rightwing governor Ron DeSantis who is widely expected to compete with Trump though he has yet to declare is also repeatedly seen on the network Many many things have changed in American politics since 2016 but one thing has stayed the same Donald Trump s position as the most popular man in the Republican party He s been in a commanding position among Republicans ever since clinching its presidential nomination more than six years ago and that dynamic hasn t meaningfully changed in the years since Case in point the latest batch of opinion polls show him essentially blowing all the other potential contenders for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination out of the water As Sebastian Gorka made clear at the start of today s events CPAC is very much a convention of the hardcore Maga Trump speaks tomorrow but his most powerful presumed challenger next year Florida governor Ron DeSantis isn t showing up at all Instead CPAC attendees will today hear from Nikki Haley who is running next year and Mike Pompeo Trump s former secretary of state who is expected to launch a campaign CPAC attracts conservatives from across the country We ll try to let you know what they think of Trump s challengers and whether they agree that after all that s happened he remains the best man to lead the GOP Good morning US politics blog readers We re coming to you today from Oxon Hill Maryland a place not everyone has heard of but which is currently host to an event many of you have the annual Conservative Political Action Conference Sebastian Gorka a former White House adviser to Donald Trump who just took the stage encapsulated its purpose well in his

7,  Create chaos Leandro Trossard is delivering Arsenal s Plan B in title bid When Mikel Arteta moved for Leandro Trossard in January he knew Arsenal would be getting more than a winger Trossard has spent much of his career drifting in off the left flank but that was never the full story only a month previously he had lined up against his future employers as a nominal centre forward and his versatility at a time when Arteta s options in that area were limited was a crucial part of the package Nonetheless it still felt bold when Arteta selected Trossard as a drifting false 9 for the trip to Leicester last week Arsenal had blazed a trail through this season s Premier League with the help of specialist attacking spearheads first Gabriel Jesus then the Brazilian s understudy Eddie Nketiah Although both are mobile intense clever players who know how to create space for others neither shares Trossard s creativity or polyvalence Playing Trossard where one of that pair had once operated meant recalibrating Arsenal s attack midway through a title race that will be decided on tweaks details and fine margins Two games and two wins against a bland Leicester and a stuffy Everton are not evidence of a revolution not that Arteta has gone that far But Trossard s role and its impact on his fellow attackers had a big influence in the details behind both victories Gabriel Martinelli s winner at the King Power Stadium was a case in point the scorer foraging inside to take an assist from Trossard who had drifted out to the left When Bukayo Saka broke Everton s resistance he did so from the right inside forward position Trossard had again moved to the left and Martinelli had made a crossfield run to the right wing which distracted Vitalii Mykolenko enough for Saka to be given a vital half yard when the roaming left back Oleksandr Zinchenko teed him up Martinelli soon scored the second from an orthodox striker s position It would be a stretch to say Arsenal had become predictable particularly as they had put four past Aston Villa the week before Arteta s switch But results such as the frustrating home draws with Newcastle and Brentford not to mention the stuttering defeat at Goodison Park had not been occurring earlier in the season Arsenal s blip was fleeting but needed heading off a change to the angles of attack used in the season s first half can keep opponents guessing the second time around Arteta extolled the virtues of unpredictability before Saturday s visit of Bournemouth who should not be the toughest nut to crack When you have players that can change formations between phases or during games it s even better he said Because obviously opponents are really well prepared and know what to expect So that uncertainty always creates a bit of chaos and teams need to adapt what they do especially if you are able to dominate games It s another element to make you stronger Trossard s marauding presence facilitates that chaos and it will be instructive to see whether Arteta sees the past week as a viable blueprint for the long term or indeed for assignments against tougher opposition His hand has been forced to an extent Jesus is not back from the injury sustained at the World Cup and Nketiah who had stepped in to fine effect before misfiring in recent weeks has been managing a problem with his right ankle that may see him miss out this weekend Arteta could have made Martinelli his central attacker but has instead sculpted a front line whose movement is designed to baffle The impact on the left forward Martinelli in particular has been noticeable He had struck up an instant relationship with Jesus partly founded on a mutual understanding of when to interchange positions But he had struggled for form in his compatriot s absence and Arsenal were struggling to get him close to goal hardly ideal given Martinelli is an outstanding finisher Much of his hard work on the wing was leading him down tramlines or into blind alleys but he has scored three times in the last two following his walked in clincher at Villa You can see that spark again in him Arteta said Trossard has given him licence to attack the central areas in which he can be lethal Realistically Jesus whose dynamism was so fundamental to Arsenal s turbocharged first few months of 2022 23 will return to the starting XI as soon as he is deemed fit enough That will probably be after this month s international break Arteta professed pleasure at how well other players had stepped up but would not go along with the idea Jesus will have trouble regaining his place Probably that wouldn t be fair on him because he was starting every single game and what he produced for the team was phenomenal he said Would the greener Mykhailo Mudryk have performed Trossard s role to similar effect if Arsenal had landed their first choice transfer target It seems unlikely Regardless Arteta has by a mixture of accident and design happened upon a plan B that may have freshened Arsenal up at the perfect moment Operating with a false 9 for the first time with the domestic game s biggest prize now squarely in view has been a gutsy move by any measure If you are extremely good at what you do it doesn t matter what the opponent does it s very difficult to stop it he said It was a truism like many of his public statements but Arsenal s push has been reinvigorated thanks to extra elements of surprise  The versatile Belgian international has helped Mikel Arteta freshen up his attacking approach at the perfect time, 11.0, 11.0
8, Sean Dyche insists Everton have made factual progress since his arrival Sean Dyche insists Everton have made progress since his arrival despite being stuck in the bottom three and their emphatic midweek defeat at Arsenal Dyche won two of his first three matches after succeeding Frank Lampard as manager but Everton are back in the relegation zone after back to back losses against Aston Villa and the Premier League leaders No team in the top four divisions of English football have scored fewer goals than Everton who reduced their attacking options in January when selling Anthony Gordon and failing to sign anyone But Dyche is adamant there has been an overall improvement We can find a way of operating with this group he said My job is to look at the bigger picture and when I got here it was one point from the last five games four points from the previous nine Now it s six points in the first five It doesn t seem like a lot but it is when you ve been in that form If you re getting four points from nine games and then six points from five that is a big shift a factual shift The work is not done but factually there is progress Distance covered more efforts on goal more chances more crosses factual progress It still doesn t guarantee you anything but it does increase your chances of winning It is a process Everton are expected to be without Dominic Calvert Lewin again on Sunday when they visit Nottingham Forest in a crucial game at the bottom of the table The striker s replacement Neal Maupay has scored only once in 20 appearances this season Neal is doing the right things at the minute said Dyche He keeps getting in the box and finding chances and it s not easy just to find chances in the Premier League They will go in We want other players to do the same We want wide players driving in on the back post because we re flashing crosses across the six yard area and not quite dominating the back post They are basics but they still have to be done We are trying to mix our game and affect the game in as many different ways as we can  Sean Dyche has defended his Everton start with the team still in the bottom three and facing Nottingham Forest on Sunday, 11.0, 11.0

13, Anthony Watson hails power of visualisation in England return Anthony Watson s try for England against Wales last week came with a sense of deja vu An obvious feeling of cathartic release too after spending so long out with injury but underlying it all a familiarity For Watson had scored the try before diving into the left hand corner and dotting the ball down with his right hand In fact he had done so only days earlier during one of his visualisation blocks a preparation method the 29 year old winger swears by I don t really judge my quality of games by tries but to be able to score in the corner was nice and something I had spent a lot of the week visualising he says That is how I try to calm myself down before games It is weird how it happened exactly how I had pictured it Literally in that corner because I was playing on the left wing and it was finishing with the ball in my right hand in that kind of style Watson has been using visualisation techniques as both a way to prepare for matches and cope with long term injuries for years It started from his work with the renowned mind coach Don Macpherson and he does it a handful of times 20 minutes on each occasion in the buildup to a game An NFL fan Watson chuckles when it is put to him how the Green Bay quarterback Aaron Rodgers recently spent four days in a darkness retreat I don t think I m ready for that but techniques such as those he does use are increasingly commonplace in sport Wayne Rooney used to talk about having a memory before the game and would seek out the kit man to find out what colour he would be wearing to enhance the process and Watson believes it is of increasing importance in rugby It has happened a few times when I have scored he says The power of visualisation is so important I have scored tries and it has ended up exactly how I had it in my head It starts off with just what it would look like from a bird s eye view and then what it would feel like for me It all starts with my work with Don Macpherson that stuff puts me in good stead for what lies ahead and it just calms me That is the only time I think about the game in those periods of visualisation It gives me blocks periods of allowing myself to focus on what I need to then letting it go It is common now There is a greater respect for the power of mental techniques to prepare for games Everyone is different what will be useful for some people and completely useless for others I just found it really helpful in terms of blocking out periods to think about the game and it allows me to be chilled out and do whatever I want to do outside that More and more people are finding techniques that work for them as opposed to trying to rev up to 100 five minutes before a game There is value in athletes just connecting back to themselves but things move at a million miles an hour in sport and unfortunately you can get caught up in what the media writes both positive and negative I think that sometimes it s important to step away from that entirely and remember who you are not what people think you are Watson was making his first England start for almost two years against Wales having suffered a debilitating ACL injury in October 2021 before niggling calf hamstring and quad problems struck at the wrong time as far as international windows were concerned The road to recovery has been difficult but visualisation has helped along the way It s something that I have done a bit with long term injuries he says More to calm me down when thoughts start spiralling that s when I try to go back to that kind of stuff and come back to a more relaxed mindset Sometimes it ll be just to calm myself down for sure But most of the time it s scheduled I ll know if I need to do it this evening or tomorrow evening It s on my own If you saw me doing it you would probably think I look crazy With England enjoying a training camp in Brighton during the second fallow week of the Six Nations the focus has been on continuing Steve Borthwick s rebuild before attentions turn to France s visit to Twickenham when they reconvene in Bagshot on Monday So what does Watson have planned for next Saturday He laughs and insists the script has not been finalised but France should be wary of a player finally fit again and reaping the rewards of seeing things differently  The winger uses the technique to cope with injury and prepare for games and it led to a picture perfect try in the win against Wales in Cardiff, 11.0, 14.0

15,  Trump rival Nikki Haley seeks support from Republicans tired of losing  The Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley ventured on to Donald Trump s stomping grounds on Friday seeking support from rank and file Republicans who are tired of losing In remarks to a half full ballroom at the annual Conservative Political Action Conference CPAC Haley presented herself as the face of a new generation of Republican leaders making her pitch to a crowd still overwhelmingly loyal to Trump her 76 year old former boss and rival for the party s nomination We ve lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections Haley said an implicit acknowledgment of Trump s 2020 defeat that many in attendance refuse to accept Our cause is right she continued But we have failed to win the confidence of a majority of Americans That ends now Haley highlighted her conservative victories as governor of South Carolina and UN ambassador during the Trump administration vowing as president to renew an America that s strong and proud not weak and woke Playing to the audience of conservative activists Haley spent much of her speech condemning the subjects that dominate outrage on the right Joe Biden socialism and the media In case you didn t notice the liberal media s heads are exploding about my run for president she said of being a conservative woman of color I am proof that liberals are wrong about everything they say about America One of the Republican s loudest applause lines was when Haley after describing herself as the first minority female governor in history declared America is not a racist country She also doubled down on her call to subject all politicians over the age of 75 to a mental competency test careful to aim the attack at Biden who is 80 But the requirement would also apply to Trump Haley lashed out at CNN s Don Lemon who said in response to her call for such assessments that the 51 year old Republican was past her prime Lemon was temporarily taken off air and later expressed regret for the comment Haley s campaign is selling beer koozies that say Past my prime and Hold my beer After finishing her speech Haley waded into a crowd of supporters gathered in the main hall of the venue As she posed for photos some attendees heckled her shouting We love Trump and Rino a derogatory label for Republican politicians viewed as insufficiently conservative It stands for Republican in name only Haley never mentioned Trump by name in her speech and has been careful to avoid direct criticism of him since launching her bid for president In a recent interview she pledged to support Trump if he were to win the nomination Haley was the first major Republican candidate to challenge him for the party s nomination But she was not the only potential aspirant to speak at the conservative gathering Vivek Ramaswamy a biotech multimillionaire and author who announced his candidacy for president was also scheduled to speak at the conference following another 2024 hopeful Trump s former secretary of state Mike Pompeo Trump will headline the event with an hour long speech on Saturday evening Once a magnet for Republican rising stars CPAC will not hear from several possible 2024 hopefuls this year The Florida governor Ron DeSantis who is widely expected to announce a run for president in the coming months skipped the conservative conference and spoke instead at a dueling event hosted by the conservative Club For Growth in Florida this weekend Also absent were potential presidential aspirants former vice president Mike Pence Senator Tim Scott of South Carolina and South Dakota s governor Kristi Noem Public opinion surveys underscore the challenging road ahead for Haley She trails far behind Trump who remains the clear frontrunner and DeSantis hovering at around 5 according to a RealClearPolitics polling average That enduring affection for the former president was on full display at the Gaylord National Resort amp Convention Center underscoring the challenge his rivals face as they vie for the nomination Attendees wearing Trump 2024 hats and Trump was right T shirts posed for pictures in a replica Oval Office Trump s rump was bedazzled on the back of one woman s jeans And the former president is all but certain to win the unscientific presidential straw poll of CPAC attendees as he did last year I made up my mind on November 3 2020 and haven t changed it since said Donna Shannen of Pennsylvania who was attending her first CPAC along with Dawn Bancroft Both derided Haley as a traitor for condemning Trump s role in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol They said Haley s later attempts to soften those comments were a sign of weakness and hypocrisy Shannen said she would prefer Haley directly challenge Trump rather than try to have it both ways with veiled criticism and overt praise If she can t even attack her own opponents in her own party how is she going to attack Kim Jong un or Xi Jinping she said Haley did resonate with some attendees Leaving the ballroom after her remarks several young women said they were inspired by her message her foreign policy experience and the possibility of electing the first female president I think she is a way better candidate than Trump would be I don t think he can win said Ashleigh Dyson a college student at St Mary s College of Maryland who said it was crazy that the US had never sent a woman to the White House Carolyn Wilson also a student at St Mary s said she believed Haley could win over independent and swing voters who recoiled from the Republican party during Trump s presidency She added that being a woman would probably help Haley navigate a bare knuckled primary race She s used to that pushback Wilson said noting that there was a man who loudly booed Haley during her remarks at CPAC She didn t even bat an eye  Ex UN ambassador and 2024 contender presents herself as face of new generation in pitch to CPAC crowd

New Delhi Borrell said At least this time he stayed and he listened This is a small improvement but it s important I think it s better than nothing Borrell said he would oppose any effort to boot Russia from the G20 because we have to keep ways of talking or at least listening if not talking Lavrov and the US secretary of state Antony Blinken spoke briefly on the margins of the G20 meeting on Thursday in what was believed to be the pair s first one on one conversation in person since Russia s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine Ukraine has ordered a mandatory evacuation of families and vulnerable residents from Kupiansk and adjacent northeastern territories amid fears that Russian forces will retake the frontline eastern city and rail hub Russian troops retreated from key cities in the northeastern Kharkiv region including Kupiansk and Ukraine recaptured it last September The Kharkiv regional military administration said in a statement posted on its website on Thursday evening

meatballs and cabbage salad The sound of artillery bounces across the shallow bowl in which the city stands four or five shells a minute sometimes more fired by both Ukrainian and Russian gun crews Mostly the shells land far away but sometimes they fall on the city A little earlier one killed a 63 year old man and damaged a nursery and fire station In the queue waiting to be served is 60 year old Natalia Ivanivna wrapped up in a winter coat and scarf and carrying a stick Ivanivna says she could have been relocated earlier that day but has chosen to stay because she worries about her house being looted She tells of her concern about the cities further to the south along the eastern front Bakhmut and Vuhledar and others that have already been reduced to rubble over months of fighting It could happen here she says Viktorivna interrupts to chide her Don t be pessimistic As both women know the tides of war have twice washed over Kupiansk already Now it is threatened by a third

19, Newcastle being owned by a nation state how is this accepted and normalised   It s a fund There was something captivating about watching Tracey Crouch MP say these words in front of a parliamentary committee in December 2021 like the moment six episodes in when you realise oh yes of course that your favourite character is actually a robot replicant too Crouch was responding to the suggestion during a discussion of the fan led review of professional men s football that Newcastle United s ownership is in effect an arm of the Saudi Arabian government And it was an impressive moment in other ways evidence of the smartness the excellent optics of getting someone relatable and unaffected to front up this significant but still carefully circumscribed exercise in populism Crouch is not one of those corporate manager style MPs who appear on your TV screen looking like a werewolf dressed up as an estate agent She isn t the type of Conservative party ideologue who seems to be genuinely angry about distortions to the market as though the market is actually a coherent thing that has feelings and must never be disrespected like the Force She certainly isn t Boris Johnson with his sniggering disdain for the people he must woo and befuddle the sense the whole thing is a glorious swindle to be retold over someone else s Coquilles Saint Jacques before whisking off leaving the fridge door open wiping your hands on the curtains and taking a piss in the sink Crouch has instead always seemed like a very reasonable person Albeit one who when it comes down to it will still tell you that the moon really is made from boiled ham that a fund is always a fund and that everyone involved is just going to have to accept this With good reason too As things stand there is a very powerful structural and political need for this to be true The same process applies to any doubts surrounding the exciting new figure of Sheikh Jassim bin Hamad al Thani the billionaire from nowhere spare gold bullion tumbling from his turn ups who has made it quite clear this is not the state of Qatar buying Manchester United that he is a sheikh from Qatar but not a sheikh of Qatar And in a sense Sheikh Jassim is the Lee Harvey Oswald of Qatari sheikhs we need him to be real need the lone sheikh theory to hold up to defy the magic bullet theory the unnamed man behind the fence the grassy knoll of his current role as chairman of the Qatar Islamic Bank Frankly the alternative Qatar itself as a club owner is just too difficult to countenance from the Premier League having to cancel all future rainbow day stuff to avoid the obvious hypocrisy to the UK government instantly freezing Manchester United s business and sanctioning the sheikh because this is what they do when a football club is owned by an entity with links to a current military humanitarian disaster such as Ukraine or Yemen in the process fearlessly imperilling Britain s massive new development agreement with its gas supplier of last resort because hey some things matter more Happily though it seems this is not going to be a problem It s actually fine There is nothing to see here It s a fund It s a random rich guy Except something does seem to have gone awry on the Saudi front Someone has blundered And as they say in the San Francisco federal court this shit just got real On Tuesday lawyers for the Saudi Public Investment Fund filed documents in its ongoing LIV Golf case disputing the need to provide documents to the court The PIF which is also the owner of Newcastle United is doing this on the grounds that it is not actually a fund but an instrument of government and that its overseer Yasir al Rumayyan also chairman of Newcastle is a politician not a private individual As the fund s submission explicitly states The PIF and His Excellency Yasir Othman al Rumayyan are a sovereign instrumentality of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and a sitting minister of the Saudi government Wait What Oh dear The sale of Newcastle was waved through on the basis of specific legally binding assurances that what is being stated here is not true Yet here we have other legally binding assurances that the opposite is the case Which one is it And where does it leave the unfortunate Tracey Crouch MP who if this is true appears to have offered up false information knowingly or not to a House of Commons committee On the other hand perhaps it is time finally for some straight talking Can we just be real Because the current state of affairs is unsustainable It is absurd that there has been no debate about foreign states buying up football clubs and not just assuming control of these cultural institutions but taking a seat of power in the national game having input into how the sport should look and feel and ultimately into the distribution of resources and facilities within the British state This is a moment of profound change in English football and indeed English society It needs to be exposed to the light We need at the very least to be able to talk about it properly without playing games or pandering to political allies without having to gurgle endlessly on the internet about the East India Company or the activities of hedge funds Nation states owning football clubs how has this come to be accepted and normalised This is profound structural change the equivalent of the British government buying Anderlecht pumping in vast sponsorship deals with the NHS and Network Rail with legions of Anderlecht fans angrily defending UK foreign policy on Twitter and holding banners saying Thank You Rishi Even Fifa s statutes contain a prohibition on any kind of political interference in domestic professional football And rightly so How could a sovereign state buying a football club or taking a seat around the table of a domestic competition ever be entirely innocent If you re not seeking to gain political advantage well you re not doing your job The Premier League may investigate further those dear old legally binding assurances But given the government s tone given the economic and tactical interdependence there is already a sense here of standing off to one side cowed by the spectacle and simply watching this thing happen This article was amended on 4 March 2023 An earlier version included an image that was said to be of the Newcastle chairman Yasir al Rumayyan at St James Park However it was in fact minority shareholder Mehrdad Ghodoussi This has been removed  The current state of affairs is unsustainable with foreign countries buying up clubs and taking a seat of power in the national game, 16.0, 11.0
20, Max Verstappen has F1 rivals running scared as he chases third world title Max Verstappen confident and at ease his innate ability fused with judgment and maturity could not enter the new season in better form With a Red Bull car that looks formidable it might be considered that the only real threat to Verstappen is Verstappen himself but of such a fragility there is no sign Indeed it is dismissed by the people that matter in the paddock the drivers themselves As Formula One s defending world champion opens his challenge to take a third consecutive title in Bahrain this weekend there is an overwhelming sense that he will not exhibit one iota of weakness overconfidence or lack of focus because of his remarkable success last year If anything the men who must compete against him warn he is only growing stronger among them Lewis Hamilton well placed to recognise a champion s traits Last season the 25 year old Dutchman romped to the title with four races remaining He won 15 of the 22 meetings and was largely untouchable Even if Charles Leclerc and Ferrari s challenge had not petered out it is doubtful Verstappen could have been denied It was a consummate display of how far the driver has come since he made his debut at 17 in 2015 the impetuousness poor decision making overaggressiveness and a somewhat all or nothing approach that earned him the Mad Max moniker was nowhere to be seen Verstappen executed with a relentless clinical precision a distinctive hallmark of the great drivers and notably multiple world champions particularly the two most successful of the modern era Michael Schumacher and Hamilton There are 23 races this season beginning here in Bahrain and ending in Abu Dhabi in December It will be a long road to the championship but Verstappen goes in as firm favourite His car comfortably held the edge over Ferrari and Mercedes in testing its excess weight long stripped out and honed to Verstappen s driving style of having a pointy front end on turn in Yet there is not a chance of complacency according to Hamilton who has been wheel to wheel with him more than any other driver I don t think he will slip up the Briton said He s a world champion I wouldn t question his determination or his focus he will be just as focused as ever and it is our job to catch up I think he will be very confident they developed an amazing car last year and blew away all the records on pretty much everything I don t think they were even pushing at the end and they were still way ahead I don t see that changing necessarily starting this season It makes clear that Hamilton knows Mercedes will not be challenging at the start of the season until they can bring in the upgrades they require to begin unlocking the potential they believe is in their car Hamilton is not alone in his appraisal of Verstappen Lando Norris of McLaren who grew up admiring the Dutchman when he was in karting and has a strong friendly relationship with him believes if anything Verstappen s dominance is only just beginning He has changed quite a bit over the last few years He has looked a lot more focused and in the right space than he ever has done said Norris He enjoys winning races the more records he can break and set that s only motivation for him Might Verstappen break the 15 wins he scored last year he was asked with not a little incredulity I think he very possibly could do more than that Norris replied Verstappen still has his detractors especially across an increasingly vituperative and partisan F1 social media but it is notable that Norris felt entirely comfortable praising his rival It is a feeling that is widespread in the paddock He s always had what he has since he was a kid his talent is insane said Norris His work ethic is also a lot better than people think He just has a very good ability to understand the limit at any instance rain or shine He has the perfect understanding of where the limit is in every aspect His natural ability is outstanding At the start of the season it will fall to Ferrari to put the pressure on him but the Scuderia adapting to the new team principal Fr d ric Vasseur appear to still be trying to catch Red Bull Leclerc will form the schwerpunkt of their assault but while he certainly has the talent to fight Verstappen he has to have the tools and at this stage Ferrari need a little more Not that Verstappen or Red Bull are taking anything for granted as Verstappen noted here with undertones of ominous intent What you have learned throughout the whole year last year gives you a much better understanding of the car he said That naturally makes it better but that doesn t mean that we are satisfied We re never satisfied you always want to do better Red Bull look to be the new dominant force in F1 Verstappen has stuck with them since the beginning and both parties are reaping the rewards The former driver and Sky Sports broadcaster Naomi Schiff grew up inspired by Verstappen s career in karting where his talent had already marked him as an unmissable prospect Max was a household name in the world of karting she said The guy just won absolutely everything Some drivers really need a car underneath them to be properly set up to be perfect to get the most out of it But some can drive wheelbarrows quickly and Max is one of those If Mercedes and Ferrari can bring the fight to Red Bull this season it will be a challenge enthusiastically embraced In Verstappen they have a rare talent perhaps beginning to define an era of F1 that will come to bear his name  On the eve of the season opener Lewis Hamilton and Lando Norris fear the Red Bull driver s dominance is only beginning, 14.0, 14.0

the New York Times as Patricia Neal and writer wed a dynamic he was initially pretty into until as Carmela Ciuraru points out he started to resent her for earning more and being more famous Dahl played a key role in Neal s recovery from two major strokes but essentially bullied her back into health goaded and humiliated his wife into recovery Not a great few weeks of press for him it has to be said Ciuaru s new book Lives of the Wives goes deep on Dahl and Neal s marriage as well as four other notorious literary couplings featuring a lot of drinking and some psychological abuse But she stresses that she doesn t think in black and white about either these writers or their work Most of the people in this book suffered a lot of trauma in childhood she says They were damaged people

A good husband award for Henry Frankel After six decades together Frankel noticed his wife Ida speaking to framed pictures in their cosy New York apartment then to author photographs on book jackets These conversations were a sign of the onset of Alzheimer s one that as Frankel tells Dasha Kiper he kicked himself for not acting on earlier As Ida s memory loss worsened Henry felt wounded by her retreat into her two dimensional relationship and his decreasing relevance to her and ashamed of himself for feeling hurt What do I expect he asked Kiper For her to say Ooh you are such a good husband Kiper s piece paints a tender and vidid portrait of a marriage in its twilight It s full of insight into the difficulties faced by carers of people with dementia to whom loved ones symptoms can sometimes feel like a betrayal But it s also a sensitive look at the way we experience social connection and the pain of rejection more generally Because we re wired to care what people think
