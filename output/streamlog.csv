0|Burning tires and bridges US residents shocked by firm s bitcoin mining plan A crypto mining company in Pennsylvania is seeking to burn tires to produce bitcoin prompting an outcry from residents and environmental groups Stronghold Digital Mining says it is repurposing waste materials while opponents worry about the risks of emissions to human health The production of cryptocurrency is an enormously energy intensive process Its electricity consumption accounts for an estimated 113 terawatt hours a year which is roughly the amount of electricity that countries such as Kazakhstan the Philippines and Ukraine each used in 2022 Stronghold has been burning coal waste to create cheap power for cryptocurrency since 2021 when it bought the Panther Creek power plant in Nesquehoning Pennsylvania It is a controversial approach because although the removal of coal waste can help remediate contaminated land the process emits greenhouse gases and other harmful chemicals It can take twice as much waste coal to produce the same amount of electricity that regular coal would produce The company also says it sometimes needs to burn tire derived fuel made of shredded vehicle tires to make the combustion of waste coal more efficient Additives such as the tire fuel are especially needed when the quality of the coal refuse is low in energy content Stronghold spokesperson Naomi Harrington told the Guardian The crypto miner which receives state subsidies to burn waste coal already holds a temporary permit to test the use of tire derived fuel It is seeking permanent permission for tires to comprise up to 15 or 78 000 tons of its fuel I was shocked said Carol Etheridge who lives less than five miles away from the Panther Creek plant It s terrible I can t even believe that people would be allowed to burn tires The US Environmental Protection Agency has in the past on an archived webpage last updated in 2016 described burning tires for fuel as preferable to landfilling them although environmental advocates criticize the practice It poses risks to the health of people living nearby said Charles McPhedran an attorney with Earthjustice which is fighting the company s tire application This sort of disposal of tires is a last resort Combusting tires can create dioxins and furans highly toxic chemicals linked to cancer and known to be slow to break down in the environment Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons PAHs several of which are carcinogenic are also associated with burning tires They are clearly looking to reduce their fuel costs said Rob Altenburg of local environmental group PennFuture There is no analysis for how this will add to the existing burden of legacy pollution in the area The facility is within two miles of communities the state has defined as environmental justice areas Residents of Carbon county along with environmental groups have sent letters of concern to the county commissioner and the Pennsylvania department of environmental protection DEP Stronghold Digital Mining has received seven violations from the DEP for not complying with emissions standards It said in a statement to the Guardian that its operations use the best available control technology for air pollution controls It also said that by burning waste coal Stronghold has reclaimed over 1 050 acres of once unusable land in Pennsylvania Without these operations the waste coal would remain unremediated and continue to harm local communities by polluting waterways and emitting toxins into the atmosphere without any sort of emissions control There is an active local debate on whether it is environmentally sound to burn coal waste owing to the pollution this releases If it remains in place it can leech toxins Now the question of tires has come to the fore Burning tires to fuel something like bitcoin or cryptocurrency which gives no value to anybody here locally in my mind is really unacceptable Etheridge said  Stronghold Digital Mining contends it is repurposing waste material but those living near by are outraged by the proposal|16.0|2.0

2|Hurricane Idalia clean up begins after heartbreaking destruction in south eastern US Residents across the south eastern US were beginning the clean up from Hurricane Idalia on Thursday as Joe Biden signed a major disaster declaration for Florida and the weakened but still powerful tropical storm dumped torrents of rain in North Carolina and Virginia The worst of the devastation was evident along Florida s Gulf coast where Idalia tore ashore on Wednesday as a category 3 hurricane with gusts of 160mph and sent a surge of seawater of up to 16ft far inland through vulnerable low lying communities Roofs were torn from some buildings houses were submerged by water from the Gulf of Mexico and flash flooding and thousands of downed trees and power lines littered a trail from Florida s west coast to Wilmington North Carolina Florida s Republican governor Ron DeSantis toured some of the worst hit areas on Thursday afternoon with Deanne Criswell administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency and said he was heartbroken at what he saw He said there was one confirmed fatality in a storm related traffic accident Torrential rain and significant inland and coastal flooding meanwhile continued in Georgia the Carolinas and Virginia as forecasters warned that the grip of Idalia still a tropical storm with winds of 65mph would not be fully loosened until late Thursday or early Friday Biden has said he will visit Florida over the weekend to survey damaged caused by the powerful storm The president s signature on the major disaster declaration frees federal funds to reimburse state and local authorities and individuals for rebuilding But he warned in an afternoon press conference at the White House that funding was not unlimited We re going to need a whole hell of a lot more money he said in reference to congressional pushback against Fema s need for more relief funds after recent natural disasters including fires on the island of Maui in Hawaii Analysts said that Idalia which unofficially is being blamed for the deaths of two motorists in Florida and a man trying to clear a felled tree in Georgia could become the costliest climate disaster to affect the US this year with an initial estimated price tag up to 20bn DeSantis and Criswell visited Cedar Key which was submerged for several hours on Wednesday Horseshoe Beach and Steinhatchee three of the most badly affected areas I ve seen a lot of really heartbreaking damage When people lose a church when they lose their home when they lose a business this was really the day after the impact and it was very raw he said When you have your whole life s work into say a business and it ends up under 5ft of water that s a lot of work you ve got to do It was very difficult to see I know it s not easy now I know it s going to be a lot of work But we will get everyone back on their feet Criswell said before and after satellite imagery was being used alongside ground inspections to identify the areas of greatest need across the affected region We re also doing our damage assessments from the air using the Civil Air Patrol as well as space so we can get a true impact of the overall damage We ll use all of that information to help determine what additional programs potentially need to be added she said Record or near record high water levels were reported in many areas including Charleston Harbor South Carolina and Cedar Key Clearwater Beach and St Petersburg in Florida the National Weather Service said After leaving the US mainland early Thursday Idalia s center was forecast to continue weakening as it moves towards the south east and an uncertain path south west of Bermuda by the weekend It will remain a tropical storm but no longer threatening land for at least the next several days Daniel Brown a senior storm specialist at the National Hurricane Center NHC in Miami said As a reminder that mid August to mid October is the peak of the six month Atlantic hurricane season that runs until November Idalia is one of five active tropical disturbances Tropical Storm Jose formed on Thursday morning the 10th named storm of what the NHC said would be an above average season featuring six to 11 hurricanes up to five of them major of category 3 status or higher with sustained winds in excess of 111mph I don t think anybody can deny the impact of a climate crisis any more Biden said on Wednesday as he addressed recovery efforts for Idalia at the White House Just look around Historic floods I mean historic floods More intense droughts extreme heat significant wildfires have caused significant damage In a rare moment of political unity Biden praised DeSantis who is seeking his party s presidential nomination to run against him for his handling of the storm I think he trusts my judgment and my desire to help and I trust him to be able to suggest this is not about politics this is about taking care of the people of his state the president said About 120 000 customers remained without power on Thursday evening from a peak of more than half a million according to poweroutage us In Georgia the figure was below 60 000 In Valdosta Georgia where the Republican governor Brian Kemp announced a state of emergency lasting until early September and in Florida s Pasco county north of Tampa boat crews were attempting to rescue dozens of residents trapped in flooded homes on Wednesday night DeSantis said earlier on Thursday before the first storm related fatality was confirmed that 40 mostly high water rescue missions had been successfully completed by the national guard the US Coast Guard and other agencies When you have a storm hitting close to 130mph just under category 4 and not as of now have any reported fatalities it s probably something that most people would not have bet on four or five days ago he said  Tropical storm moves into Atlantic but torrential rain and inland flooding still likely in North Carolina officials warn|1.0|2.0
3|Jail housing Charles Bronson is fundamentally unsafe says watchdog The high security jail that holds Charles Bronson needs urgent support amid the high rate of attacks on prison officers and chronic staff shortages the watchdog has said The chief inspector of prisons Charlie Taylor wrote to the justice secretary Alex Chalk to issue an urgent notification for improvement at HMP Woodhill after an inspection found the Milton Keynes jail was fundamentally unsafe Staff at Woodhill which has dangerous category A offenders among its inmates and accommodates up to 500 prisoners were subject to the highest rate of serious assaults in England and Wales and inspectors found bullying and intimidation by prisoners to be commonplace The watchdog said the low morale meant many staff had voted with their feet with more officers leaving than joining and with no indication that the situation would improve Inspectors found high levels of violence and drug use at the jail when they visited between 14 August and 25 August There has been a worrying decline in conditions at Woodhill between the five inspections carried out since 2014 Taylor said in his letter Reported incidents of violence at the prison had risen sharply with 298 attacks recorded in the 12 months leading up to the inspection compared with 182 assaults prior to the previous inspection The use of force against inmates was also among the highest in the adult male estate but leaders had yet to take effective action to make the prison safer At least 26 prisoners were found self isolating in their cells in fear for their safety and the rate of self harm was the highest in the country for men s prisons Taylor said This was a very concerning inspection Woodhill is a complex high risk prison holding prisoners convicted of serious offences It simply cannot operate effectively with such chronic staff shortages Urgent support is needed from His Majesty s Prison and Probation Service to help Woodhill and other establishments to develop credible long term plans that improve staff recruitment and crucially staff retention It should be of considerable concern to us all that only a third of the prisoners at Woodhill said that their experience would make them less likely to reoffend in the future a far lower proportion than at similar prisons Staff shortages meant education classes and work were often cancelled for prisoners while the library had been shut since 2020 Pia Sinha chief executive of the Prison Reform Trust described the report as shocking adding After repeated warnings it is extremely disappointing that the prison now finds itself in this position Ministers urgently need to get a grip on what has gone wrong The prisons minister Damian Hinds said The findings of this report demonstrate the urgent need for improvement at HMP Woodhill and we will be working closely and quickly with the prison to set out how it can address these issues Ministry of Justice figures published in July showed the number of prisons rated outstanding had fallen to its lowest point in six years PA Media contributed to this report  Urgent support needed over high levels of violence and drugs at understaffed HMP Woodhill|1.0|0.0
4|Premier League 10 things to look out for this weekend Hammers hope to build on promise Winning the Conference League did not do much to lift the pressure on David Moyes after an underwhelming domestic season but the clouds look to be lifting New signings have joined to bolster the ranks and only two points have been dropped in three matches to put the Hammers second behind Manchester City Things could hardly be going better One problem Moyes will soon face is European football an activity that hindered West Ham s league form last season To limit its impact picking up points in winnable matches such as Friday s trip to Kenilworth Road will be crucial At this stage last season West Ham had failed to muster a point and they collected only four from their opening seven matches They have the foundations to build on this time around and Luton s first Premier League fixture at Kenilworth Road will be a tricky prospect but a confident West Ham will not want to lose what they have worked hard to build Will Unwin Luton v West Ham Friday 8pm all times BST Will Archer add to Everton s troubles Cameron Archer began this season on Aston Villa s bench as they lost 5 1 at Newcastle on the Premier League s opening day The England Under 21s striker who scored twice as the European Championship crown was secured in Georgia this summer had hoped to break into Unai Emery s first team but instead has joined Sheffield United for 18m His new manager Paul Heckingbottom must hope the striker reprises the sort of form that brought him 11 goals and six assists in 20 appearances for Michael Carrick s Middlesbrough in the Championship last season Heckingbottom has signed eight new mainly inexperienced players since winning promotion but as Sheffield United prepare to face Everton in an already vital looking six pointer at Bramall Lane the Blades are still feeling the loss of two players they have sold the midfielder Sander Berge and the principal striker Iliman Ndiaye They must hope Archer will at least solve the attacking gap vacated by the Senegal player s exit On the basis of Middlesbrough s woeful start to this Championship campaign Carrick is certainly missing a forward who scored four goals in 14 first team appearances for Villa Louise Taylor Sheffield United v Everton Saturday 12 30pm Mee time for Brentford Ben Mee won supporters player of the season in his first year in west London but is yet to get his Premier League campaign under way after injury stopped him from partaking in their opening three matches He returned in midweek to play against Newport in the Carabao Cup leaving Thomas Frank with a decision to make this weekend Nathan Collins and Ethan Pinnock have been his centre back pairing so far after Frank changed from a back five to a four this season It is unlikely the manager will revert to three central defenders mainly because the change in formation was brought about by Ivan Toney s absence so it is a question of whether he is bold enough to drop Collins or Pinnock to bring Mee s added experience into a team lacking it Joachim Andersen s equaliser last weekend showed Brentford have a soft underbelly an issue Mee could help to address WU Brentford v Bournemouth Saturday 3pm How will Spurs react at Burnley Ange Postecoglou said he was at the discovery stage of his Tottenham tenure when explaining why nine changes were made for the Carabao Cup second round exit at Fulham As well as discovering the limitations of his fringe players at Craven Cottage where early season momentum was hit by the performance level and the penalty shootout defeat the Spurs manager received further evidence of James Maddison s importance merely four games into their careers with the club Maddison was among those benched at Fulham and entered the fray only in the 82nd minute as Postecoglou sought to avoid spot kicks The creativity he had sprinkled over Spurs win at Bournemouth three days earlier was badly missed along with an opportunity to pursue much needed silverware There was a complacency to the first setback of Postecoglou s reign and he will be looking to Maddison to spark the reaction against a Burnley team without a Premier League point so far Andy Hunter Burnley v Tottenham Saturday 3pm Jackson continuing early form Chelsea have not exactly earned a reputation for financial prudence during the last year but they deserve credit for spotting Nicolas Jackson s potential In a summer when Manchester United paid 72m to sign Rasmus H jlund from Atalanta Jackson is looking comparative value for money after leaving Villarreal for 32m The striker may have some rough edges but he has not been fazed by being handed the responsibility of trying to fix Chelsea s problems in the final third The 21 year old s all round game has impressed he caused plenty of problems for Liverpool and West Ham with his pace strength movement and link up play and he displayed a poacher s instinct when he scored from close range during last week s win over Luton Mauricio Pochettino will hope Jackson s momentum continues when Chelsea host Nottingham Forest Jacob Steinberg Chelsea v Nottingham Forest Saturday 3pm Leaders looking imperious already While Manchester City s prospective title rivals Liverpool and Arsenal have dropped points Pep Guardiola s cold eyed win machine has reeled off three victories from three games This has been done despite the exits of Ilkay G ndogan and Riyad Mahrez and with Kevin De Bruyne ruled out due to injury until next year since the first half of the opening night win at Burnley But City are as expert in the market as their neighbours Manchester United are middling and in has come J r my Doku a wideman to be followed by Matheus Nunes from Wolves This means Guardiola again will have a frightening depth of squad quality and as Fulham arrive with four points from their three Premier League outings this should be victory number 201 under the Catalan in the competition Jamie Jackson Manchester City v Fulham Saturday 3pm Baleba brings new option to Brighton He will be the future of the club said the Brighton manager Roberto De Zerbi of his new signing Carlos Baleba The hype that is constantly associated with the Seagulls recruitment of players means there is growing pressure on whoever arrives regardless of their reputation Many will already be earmarking the Cameroonian for a big money move in two years In the immediate future the 19 year old will be a natural replacement for Mois s Caicedo who performed his duties superbly in midfield to earn his record breaking move to Chelsea Baleba made only 19 appearances for Lille last season an indication of his lack of experience He will get the best schooling possible but may start from the bench against Newcastle to get a glimpse of what being a Premier League player entails because Brighton will be up against a classy collection of players and knowing how to shut them down will be a tough task for De Zerbi and his men WU Brighton v Newcastle Saturday 5 30pm Liverpool s evolution up front Newcastle may have been a win for the ages in the eyes of Trent Alexander Arnold but it needs to be a turning point for Darwin N ez at Liverpool the moment when his undoubted talent becomes an integral and consistent part of J rgen Klopp s formidable attack The Uruguay international already a cult hero at Anfield before his match winning heroics at St James Park has shown more quality in front of goal than his detractors would like to believe since arriving for a potential club record 85m from Benfica last summer But questions over his suitability to Klopp s finely tuned tactics and willingness to start a defensive shift from the front remain legitimate As the Liverpool manager s selections testify N ez is yet to start this season and did so in only three of the final 10 games for which he was available at the end of his first campaign missing the last three matches with a toe injury His Newcastle heroics merit reward in another high quality test against an in form Aston Villa AH Liverpool v Aston Villa Sunday 2pm Forward thinking for Wolves It may have been League One opposition but Wolves managed to score five goals in their Carabao Cup thrashing of Blackpool in midweek The better news is that three different forwards got on the scoresheet Regardless of the opponents getting into a rhythm in front of goal can only be good news for Gary O Neil s bullpen of strikers Sasa Kalajdzic has two in as many games while F bio Silva netted his first Wolves goal since May 2021 and Nathan Fraser scored on his debut As Wolves showed against Manchester United in their opening match they can create chances but struggle to score them Last season they mustered a pitiful 31 goals in 38 matches which can partly be attributed to a lack of confidence from their misfiring strikers Ra l Jim nez and Diego Costa have left leaving a new set of forwards to take on the pressure of scoring enough goals to keep Wolves in the Premier League Tuesday night s efforts will have lifted a burden now they need to follow it up at Selhurst Park to keep the momentum going WU Crystal Palace v Wolves Sunday 2pm Ten Hag s latest midfield conundrum Manchester United return to north London a fortnight after losing 2 0 to Tottenham Despite victory over Nottingham Forest Erik ten Hag still has far more questions than answers about his team this season United could easily have lost all three of their opening matches Wolves failed to convert chances while Forest gave up a two goal lead and had a man sent off The midfield has clearly been the issue with every combination selected so far looking unable to cope with the rigours of the opposition Christian Eriksen was used alongside Casemiro against Forest but struggled with the physicality of the fixture Against Arsenal it would seem sensible to have someone more robust in that area to help the Brazilian and Scott McTominay seems the ideal candidate for the role He has his detractors but does perform his duties diligently in midfield while having the stamina to get up and down for the entire match United are unlikely to control proceedings at the Emirates so bringing in the Scotland international would give them much needed energy in the middle of the pitch WU Arsenal v Manchester United Sunday 4 30pm Comments will open at 7am BST on Friday There are crunch showdowns at the Emirates and at Bramall Lane while Manchester City already look imperious|11.0|11.0

6|Tokyo braces for another big one on 100th anniversary of deadly quake The earthquake that struck the Tokyo region two minutes before noon on 1 September 1923 was so powerful that it destroyed the central weather bureau s seismometers Over almost two days fires triggered by household gas burners chemicals and overhead wires raged through the wooden buildings of eastern Tokyo s low lying shitamachi neighbourhoods By the time the blazes had been extinguished or burned themselves out an estimated 105 000 people were dead or missing and most of the city s buildings had been destroyed including 290 000 homes The damage was estimated at 5 5bn equivalent to 37 of Japan s gross domestic product at the time As the Japanese capital marks the 100th anniversary on Friday of what became known as the Great Kant Earthquake its residents are bracing themselves for another big one Seismologists believe there is a 70 chance of a massive earthquake hitting the Tokyo metropolitan area within the next 30 years killing up to 23 000 people and causing direct damage reaching 47tn 254bn Widespread disruption to manufacturing and services caused by damage to transport networks and power cuts could reach an additional 48tn along with price rises and a plummeting yen according to Japan s Cabinet Office About 4 53 million people would be unable to return home in the aftermath of the quake according to an estimate published last year by the Tokyo metropolitan government The Tokyo of today bears little resemblance to the city levelled by the 7 9 magnitude offshore quake a century ago Evidence of the destruction is preserved at a memorial museum in eastern Tokyo piles of nails welded into a grotesque sculpture by the heat from the fires charred printing machines buckled bicycles and black and white photos of crowds of dazed residents seeking an exit from the mayhem The human toll in that disaster came not only from the collapsed burned buildings Mobs armed with swords and iron bars and encouraged by police murdered a large number of Korean residents after baseless rumours that they were exploiting the chaos to loot and poison wells The 1923 disaster provided valuable lessons for a country that sits on the Pacific s seismically hyperactive ring of fire and accounts for fifth of the world s most powerful earthquakes The Kant disaster marked the dawn of seismic design of structures in Japan according to Yoshiaki Nakano an earthquake engineering expert from the National Research Institute for Earth Science and Disaster Resilience New building codes to make structures more resistant to seismic activity were introduced a year later and have been adapted in the decades since to reflect the technological advances made after other powerful earthquakes in Japan including the 2011 triple disaster in which more than 18 000 people died and the Kobe earthquake in January 1995 that killed 6 000 While other countries such as Turkey and Syria are given horrific reminders of the vulnerability of their buildings Japan has some of the most stringent safety regimes in the world demonstrated by the terrifying sight on 11 March 2011 of skyscrapers swaying but remaining upright in a 9 magnitude quake The ever present threat of earthquakes and tsunami forms part of the Japanese psyche from the schoolchildren who know instinctively to pull on their protective zukin hoods and take shelter beneath their desks to the stockpiling by Tokyo authorities of millions of instant meals Few people in Japan will not have been startled by a smartphone alert warning them of an impending quake theoretically giving them just enough time to take cover the occasional false alarm notwithstanding On Friday self defence force personnel members of the emergency services politicians and public officials will take part in simulations to remind them of Japan s vulnerability and how to survive the worst on national Disaster Prevention Day introduced in 1960 to commemorate the 1923 quake In his 1983 book Low City High City Edward Seidensticker speculated that relocating the capital would have made sense to some policymakers before the 1923 disaster Tokyo lies in earthquake country he wrote Another flattening earthquake was bound to come It has not come in the more than 60 years since the last one but the assumption that it will come some day is universal But discussions on moving the capital or some of its main functions to Kyoto or Osaka gained little traction and the breakneck pace of reconstruction appeared to justify the decision to retain Tokyo as imperial Japan s political and economic centre A century on with the long predicted seismic shock yet to come the concentration of power and money in Tokyo has dramatically raised the stakes The Great Kant quake involved a collision between tectonic plates beneath ocean floor plates said Prof Takaaki Kato an expert on safety and urban planning at Tokyo University s institute of industrial science That type of earthquake occurs every 200 to 300 years But he added that doesn t mean we can relax He said In the 100 year period before an offshore earthquake occurs there will be quakes of at least 7 magnitude whose epicentres are inland and we can expect several quakes like that in the Tokyo metropolitan area I can t say exactly when and where only that it will happen and that we should be prepared for it  Japan has learned key lessons from the 1923 earthquake that killed 105 000 people but rapid growth of the capital has raised the stakes|1.0|1.0

forced Svitolina to serve for it I can t wait to see her try Svitolina is something Under pressure serving at 30 all she smokes a backhand winner down the line and onto the line then secures 5 3 with an ace Pavlyuchenkova will now serve to stay in it and has just one remaining chance to break Wawrinka swipes a backhand long from the back and that s one set all Well played Tomas Martin Etcheverry Elsewhere Hsu has won three games in a row and now leads Norrie 3 2 in the third on serve Monfils was broken by Rublev but has just returned the compliment and Svitolina is serving 4 3 up in the third against Pavlyuchenkova Svitolina leads Pavlyuchenkova 4 1 so it s slightly odd to see her testing the robustness of her racket when she loses a point for 30 all on her serve I don t know if she loses focus but Pavlyuchenkova does snatch back one break while Wawrinka levels the breaker only to miss from the back and hand Etcheverry set point on serve Wawrinka saves it though the crowd going wild for the splendid Swiss shloch and he s soon got the balls in his hand and a 7 6 lead If he converts it s hard to see him losing and he takes control of the rally with a brilliant inside out forehand But Etcheverry gets it back Stan can t find the volleys he needs and marooned at the net he s passed Seven apiece Norrie consolidates for 2 0 in the third while Etcheverry gets an immediate mini break in his second set breaker with Wawrinkz and extends his lead to 4 1 Marion Bartoli says that Rublev needs to improve to become one of the proper elite and I agree He seems a little stuck better than almost everyone but never able to beat those better than him when it really matters she identifies his net play as an area which needs work He leads Monfils 2 0 on serve Svitolina is on one breaking Pavlyuchenlova twice for a 3 0 lead Wawrinka will shortly serve for a second set tiebreaker and actually he looks almost kempt today For shame Hsu will suspect he s cooked and I d not be surprised to see Norrie break immediately He gets 15 30 then at 30 all a one two forehand backhand punch to opposite corners give him a chance Hsu does makes deuce then misses game point and when Norrie gets advantage he dominates a long rally and eventually a forehand sails long He leads by two sets and a break Norrie serves out to lead 7 5 6 4 Hsu has had chances but Norrie s extra class is getting him through And look at Stan He breaks Etcheverry straight back easds 7 6 4 5 and it s such a joy watching him still be this good at 38 Svitolina s husband Gael Monfils is just knocking up with Andrey Rublev this should be another fun tussle Norrie meanwhile might ve thought he d broken the back of his match with Hsu but serving for a 2 0 lead at 5 2 he got himself broken instead he s just about to try again at 5 4 Oh and Etcheverry has just broken Stan so will serve for one set all at 5 3 Svitolina is some competitor She takes the second set off Pavluuchenkova 6 4 to set up the decider we re about to enjoy Cheers Svitz Mates Bryan has had to run to the interview room so this is Daniel back again I ll get my screens sorted and we ll be away The Wimbledon champion strolls into the third round after 80 uncomplicated minutes Up next Ekaterina Alexandrova the 22nd seeded Russian who made the final last week in Cleveland The American teenager Alex Michelsen has taken the first set from 23rd seeded Nicolas Jarry After breaking at 4 all Michelsen held at love to close out the set capping it with a 119mph ace out wide The 19 year old wildcard who won his first career Challenger title last month in Chicago is bidding to become the youngest American man to reach the third round in Flushing Meadows since Donald Young in 2007 Norrie has broken Hsu to open the second set then consolidated with an easy hold for 7 5 2 0 He s won 16 of the last 19 points Wawrinka has just taken a first set breaker from Etcheverry The 2016 US Open champion got the best of his Argentinian foe in a 16 shot exhchange on the decisive point of the tiebreak the third longest rally of the match hitting a vintage backhand down the line that Etcheverry couldn t handle Vondrousova isn t wasting any time over on Grandstand After taking a 6 2 opening set from Trevisan in 36 minutes she s broken the Italian for a quick 2 0 lead in the second Norrie taken the opening set from Hsu on a rather packed Court 11 After winning four straight points on Hsu s serve to break from 15 40 down Norrie finished in style with a love hold punctuated by a 93mph ace out wide Eight straight points to close the set and move one step closer to round three A straightforward affair for the 2017 US Open runner up in 54 brisk minutes on Ashe Keys hit 20 winners saved all four break points she faced and won 77 of her first serve points Next up a third round meeting on Friday with Liudmila Samsonova the No 14 seed from Russia Pavlyuchenkova has just taken a highly entertaining first set from Svitolina as the shadows encroach on Armstrong The unseeded Russian who s saved all five break points she s faced squandered a pair of set points with Svitolina serving at 5 6 15 40 but was able to break the No 26 seed from Ukraine on her third chance without letting it get to a tiebreaker Given the nationalities of the players no post match handshake is expected A message on the videoboard on Armstrong has said as much to the fans to prevent a negative reaction from the crowd Eventually Norrie secures the hold coming back from 0 40 serving three aces in the game and saving five break points for his 3 3 Otherwise I m off for a break here s Bryan Armen Graham to chill with you for the next bit Norrie finds himself down 0 40 but makes space to power a forehand winner down the line Then Hsu goes long with one of his and Norrie hits another winner on the backhand this time deuce Mainly he s attacking the fore and Hsu the back but it s windy out there meaning both have had to adjust and as I type that Norrie saves a fourth break point with an ace More deuce advantages ensue I love a happy Maddy and Keys takes the first set off Wickmayer 6 1 Has she at the age of 28 finally found equilibrium Elsewhere it s Etcheverry 3 2 Wawrinka Svitolina 3 4 Pavlyuchenkova and Hsu 3 2 Norrie all on serve He really does knock about like this Berrettini in happier times Vondrousova the Wimbledon champ breaks Trevisan right away and leads 2 0 while Svitolina and Pavlyuchenkova are 3 3 On 11 Hsu and Norrie are under way level at 1 1 Terrible luck for Berrettini who s had such annoyances with injury Bright side he was about to go down two sets and the damage didn t look too bad Rinderknech who s playing nicely meets Monfils or Rublev next Keys breaks Wickmayer at the first tie of asking to lead 2 0 Svitolina and Pavlyuchenkova are 2 2 and Wawrinka leads Etcheverry 2 1 on serve Ah he s sitting up now and by the look of things I don t think it s a serious injury Let s hope it s not a twist or sprain that ll prevent him from carrying on On 17 Etcheverry and Wawrinka are under way and oh no Playing deuce while trying to stay in the second set Berrettini chasesdown a backhand his toe appears to catch on the court he goes down and a minute later he s barely moved I hope he s just jarred it especially given all he s been through and the mental anguish of being in your prime but unable to do your thing however it did not look good Godspeed old mate Do you think Andy will announce his retirement after the game wonders Andrew Benton I do I ve not got that impression listening to him speak lately and he didn t linger at the end end so I don t think so but given his age and all he s been through I ll not be surprised whenever it comes Evening Daniel begins Simon McMahon I m a huge Murray fan and have been one of his biggest cheerleaders since the start but that s a chastening defeat My Big Book of Sporting Cliches tells me that he s earned the right to continue competing for as long as he likes but also wonders how long he can rage against the dying of the light What memories though Yes one of my all time favourite sportsfolk too a rare one who stands for something beyond being good at what he does He s still enjoying it though he won t have enjoyed that so I reckon we ll get a bit more from him yet given how well he played at Wimbledon Isner is too choked to speak properly saying he s worked as hard as he can to play in front of crowds like the one on Grandstand And off he pops into the world of leisure Rinderknech is now a set and a break up on Berrettini while Alexandrova has beaten Tsurenko Tsu v Norries will soon be with us Next on Ashe Yanina Wickmayer v Madison Keys 17 He did Khachanov on Tuesday saved a pair of match points here and that s a tremendous comeback from Mmoh who retires Isner He applauds his opponent s career while Isner buries his face in his towel the enormity of the occasion dawning on him He meets Jack Draper next Murray will be disappointed with a tame defeat he lost at the same stage of Wimbledon but that was an epic and to Tsitsipas Elsewhere Mmoh and Isner are playing a fifth set breaker it s 7 6 Isner on serve whole Martina also praises Dimitrov s tactics saying Murray is a counter puncher so by taking of pace he was forcedto create his own angles and power Dimitrov played a brutal first round match too and he was expecting five sets here so was constantly reminding himself he s here for the long haul He praises Murray as a great competitor and person says the teams are friendly with each other there are no secrets and Murray has done really well to come back But he s had some good results lately got to the semis here in 2019 and wants to go one better this term He s looked after his body well which is allowing him to keep going and knowing the end is near is really enjoying his tennis A fantastic performance from Dimitrov who with his coach Dani Valverdu previously Murray s coach hatched a plan executed it and looks well set He plays like this he ll give Zverev a thorough examination when they meet on Saturday Talking of whom Murray serving at 1 5 and deuce hits a decent forehand only to be passed brilliantly and that s match point Dimitrov He meets Murray or Dimitrov next Next on Armstrong Elina Svitolina 26 v Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova Sabalenka is happy with her performance and has she s told hit more winners at majors than any other player on the WTA tour If she does better than Swiatek here she becomes world no 1 which is one of her goals and prompted agrees that she enjoys the loudness of the US open because she s funny energetic and crazy sometimes great personality she jokes Burrage did her best there and like Boulter is playing more or less as well as she can But Sabalenka is now beyond losing to players miles below her at slams at least and it ll take something significant to stop her She meets Burel next who s just binned Pliskova Rinderknech takes the first set off Berrettini 6 4 Burel is serving for the match against Pliskova leading 6 4 5 2 and Alexandrova leads Tsurenko 6 1 0 1 Oh dear Sabalenka breaks Burrage who s missed break points herself for 6 3 4 2 then Dimitrov breaks Murray for 6 3 6 4 4 1 and even one of sport s great escapologists will struggle to get out of this one This was tight now it isn t Murray raising two break points Dimitrov saves the first with an ace out wide and the second with an animal down the middle which facilitates the clean up forehand He moves quickly through deuce and this has been a very fine performance from him If he d had this moxie at his peak he might ve done as well as he promised to He leads 3 1 in the third Oh Andrew He allows Dimitrov back into a game can t hit a first serve then on advantage swats a backhand wide and 2 1 down in the third he s on the brink every bit as amused as you imagine he is Burrage meanwhile continues to give a good account of herself leading 2 1 in the second Zverev breaks Altmaier for 2 1 in set four so need only hold his serve and he s into round three Burel has taken the first set off Pliskova 6 4 and leads 2 1 with a break in the second Berrettini and Rinderknech are level at 4 4 Murray punishes a backhand down the line to make 0 30 but Dimitrov then runs down a drop to halve the deficit However Murray then hits deep Dimitrov misses with a forehand and here come two break back points of which Murray only needs one A decent return a backhand that floats long and might this be a turning point At 3 6 4 6 1 1 there s a phenomenal quantity of work still to do but no one who ll enjoy the misery of attempting it more than the man who s got to Again Murray drops serve at the start of a set and he s in colossal trouble here He resolved precisely this predicament against Kokkinakis in Melbourne but Dimitrov is showing no signs of faltering just as Murray doesn t look like dominating Serving at 2 5 Burrage who s playing pretty well saves a set point but Sabalenka deals with it on her own delivery and leads 6 3 Another long rally at 30 15 and when Dimitrov nets Murray has a sniff But a serve out wide a big forehand into the opposite corner and Murray can only waft wide Dimitrov leads by two sets to love but will know what his opponent is capable of Murray holds so at 5 4 Griggzy will serve for a two set lead I said Burrage wasn t getting nowhere near Sabalenka s serve but at 2 4 she makes it to deuce but is still 2 5 down at the end of it Elsewhere Mmoh has come from 2 0 down to force a decider with Isner Rinderknech and Berrettini are under way and 3 2 on serve and Zverev has just served out for a 2 1 lead over Altmaier Burrage secures a pair of holds but gets nowhere near the break back she needs trailing 2 4 Murray meanwhile earns a point for one but at the end of a long and tremendous rally just misses the sideline with a backhand cross court expressing his frustrations through the medium of racket abuse When Dimitrov makes advantage though Murray sweeps a glorious backhand pass down the line for all the good it does him Second later he s 3 5 down and by the looks of things will need to win three sets straight to get through It s not often you see Murray out gameplanned and in co comms Jo Konta notes that we think we can see what Dimitrov is doing taking pace off and going backhand to backhand but when you re out there things can feel very different But he s back ion the match now after a few games at the end of the first set and start of the second which might still cost him the match He holds to 30 and at 3 4 is still in it but needs a break and fast Sabalenka is at it immediately yelling grunting and breaking Burrage for 2 0 in the first I love watching her so much the combination of power finesse and vulnerability is so compelling Boulter tells Sky she s super happy because no one is very anything anymore She loved it out there she s really happy with how she held it down and has things on which to work prior to her next match Dimitrov has been going to Murray s backhand mainly via slice taking the pace off and the Brit Scot hasn t yet come to terms with it He holds to 15 though and trails 6 3 3 2 Mmoh takes the third set 7 6 to trail Isner 2 1 Zverev and Altmaier are locked at 2 2 and a set apiece And how about this On Armstrong Jodie Burrage comes out with Aryna Sbalenka the world number two What a moment for her but can she make it a contest Less good news for Murray though who s broken again Dimitrov has now won four games in a row five as he consolidates to lead 6 3 2 0 What a win that is and she s into round three for the first time where she ll meet Tauson or Stearns either of whom she ll fancy beating Boulter meanwhile is dragged to deuce then misses a forehand Wang can t capitalise hitting a backhand wide then another error hands Boulter match point Draper hollers deep and loud he s worked and waited for this but lokoed a proper player out there He s going places Oh man what a day for Draper He was gutted to pull out of the French Open on court with injury missed Wimbledon too and now he s into round three for the second year in a row He meets Mmoh or Isner next Isner leading by two sets to love A big serve returned long 15 0 a forehand into the net 30 0 and Hurkacz looks a beaten man a longer rally a backhand swiped wide and after two hours 12 Draper has three match points Katie Boulter She breaks Wang and at 5 7 6 1 5 4 must now steel herself to serve for the match Jack Draper He breaks Hurkacz and at 6 2 6 4 6 5 must now steel himself to serve for the match This has been a terrific performance though his opponent is suffering but finishing him off is another matter entirely Boulter hangs onto her serve for 4 4 in the third Dimitrov serves out for 6 3 63 minute long set that sped up at the end and Draper holds for 5 5 in the third He meets Etcheverry or Wawrinka next and a match with the latter would be very tasty indeed Boulter finds herself serving at 30 all and when Wang lands a forehand on the white she can only net in response trouble But a body serve extricates her from immediate danger and on Ashe Murray could use something similar down 4 3 0 40 to Dimitrov Meantime Wang makes advantage but overhits into the tramlines and after all that effort Murray does likewise handing out a free break that means Dimitrov will shortly serve for the set at 5 3 I wish I had more eyes Draper holds for 4 4 but I d like to focus on Boulter if the other matches allow as that s nearing its end Murray holds to 15 the pathetic malingerer too soft to brave another deuce while Boulter holds for 3 3 in the third Draper meanwhile is now involved in a contest serving at deuce trailing 4 3 but leading 2 1 Another deuce game that Dimitrov wins to lead 3 2 while Hurkacz has to drag through deuce for the hold that gives him 4 3 in the third I ve not a clue how if he s feeling anywhere near as peaky as he looks he wins three sets straight as it gets hotter but credit to him for trying Oh look Altmaier breaks Zverev to trail 6 7 3 2 and Sinner breaks Sonego to lead 6 4 6 2 3 2 he s nearly home and eventually gets his hold for 2 2 this is a really good contest Elsewhere Zverev and Altmaier are 2 2 in the second Zverev having taken the first on a tiebreaker WQang leads Boulter 2 1 on serve in the decider and Hurkacz is hanging in there leading Draper 3 2 in the third Isner now leads Mmoh by two sets to love while Zhen and Kanepi are playing a decider the doctor visits with Hurkacz they take a while and we re back under way Draper leading 6 2 6 4 1 2 Murray of course is engaged in another sapping protracted game with Dimitrov they ve been going 35 minutes and haven t completed four games yet He has advantage There s a suggestion that Hurkacz isn t feeling great and well though Draper s playing that d explain his lack of lustre He does though rebound from 0 30 down in his next service game to lead 2 1 in the third before calling the physio But if he s unwell he ll need the doctor Wang forces Boulter to deuce and misses a break point but eventually shanks one long and that s one set apiece at 7 5 1 6 they ll now play a decider Hurkacz manages to avoid being broken in the first game of a set for the first time though he has to save an opportunity and on Ashe both commentators yell Noooo at the same time as Murray rushes into the net and right by the chair somehow flicks a winner across the face of the net That is simply incredible it earns him another break point and when Dimitrov nets he converts it A 15 minute game seven deuces just a typical acrylic afternoon with Andrew Barron Murray Altmaier ploughs through a 6 6 set only to lose the breaker 7 1 to Zverev this game then calls out the trainer to an issue with his right hand Sinner now leads Sonego 6 4 6 2 while Murray and Dimitrov are playing the fifth deuce of the game Boulter breaks Wang again so leads 5 1 in the second while Murray forces Dimitrov through deuce thanks to a typical Murray point long and packed with gets and aggression He s in the match now This time Boulter consolidates while Hurkacz might just ve arrived He s showing more patience now waiting to inject power and makes Draper serve for set two at 0 15 he steps in to despatch a fine volley But at 30 15 he can t put away his volley given two chances credit to Hurkacz for the de fence though and it s getting nervy out there all the more so when Draper misses his first serve But his second curling away is very good enough to help him make advantage and a wide serve is backed up by a definitive volley meaning he leads 6 2 6 4 Does Draper lose focus He finds himself down 15 40 serves a double and on Ashe Murray is broken to love so trials Dimitrov 0 2 the commentator on each court calling their behaviour scrappy But Boulter breaks Wang again so now leads 3 1 in the second Murray is away Dimitrov holding for 1 0 while Hurkacz sends change of ends sat under a towel and must now find a way to break Draper who s serving for the second set at 6 2 5 2 And now Boulter breaks Wang She trails 5 7 2 0 and as I type bangs a forehand down the line for 15 30 as she attempts to consolidate Wang though maeks 15 40 whereupon another fine forehand sent cross court eliminates the first break point Boulter loves that but after opening the court with a decent serve out wide she goes long with her overhead and that s 2 1 Now then Draper breaks Hurkacz again leads 6 2 4 1 and this is a proper going over Hurkacz is struggling in particular with balls to his forehand that have the pace taken off and he s running out of time to find a solution Murray must be buzzing to be back on Ashe I m certain he ll have feared it d never happen when he was having a metal hip inserted He s looking for his 201st singles win at a major this is the men s all time list 1 Roger Federer 369 2 Novak Djokovic 355 3 Rafael Nadal 314 4 Jimmy Connors 233 5 Andre Agassi 224 6 Ivan Lendl 222 7 Roy Emerson 210 8 Pete Sampras 203 9 Andy Murray 200 10 Stefan Edberg 178 Sinner breaks Sonego to lead 6 4 2 1 and Sky go to a break so we re not allowed to see Wang break Boulter for take their first set 7 5 On Ashe Muzz and Griggz emerge Draper saves a break point in consolidating and Hurkacz is struggling out there serving at 30 all and slapping a forehand putaway long after decent scurrying by his opponent He saves himself probably the set and likely the match with an ace then nails a forehand but a gloriously deft backhand pass from Draper breaks the sideline and we re back to deuce Not for long Hurkacz serves out to trail 2 6 1 2 Also going on Sinner takes the first set off Sonego 6 4 Isner playing in his final US Open leads Mmoh 6 3 and Altmaier and Zverev must be enduring some sapping rallies because their match is 3 3 having started at the same time as the others Boulter opens the court to run around her forehand clouting a winner cross court to raise her third set point but after working another forehand angle she nets and Wang seals the game from there This is a really fun contest and it s 5 5 in set one then at 15 40 she dumps a backhand while on 12 Draper hangs in the rally constantly hitting deep to Hurkacz s forehand and he breaks him in the first game of set two Now sitting at deuce what can Boulter do Boulter makes 5 4 0 30 One way traffic Draper closes out to love completing a 6 2 set and Hurkacz has some thinking to do if he can t work this out he ll soon be back home with his gerbils Draper has as we know had injury issues which in comms they speculate could be because he had a late growth spurt Let s hope that s why because it means he should soon be free of the aggravation Hurkacz holds so yerman will now serve for the set at 5 2 Boulter has broken Wang back so now leads 4 3 Altmaier does likewise to Zverev and they re at 2 2 Draper consolidates for 5 1 and this is going perfectly for him Calv returns on Draper If his body holds up then is ceiling is exceptionally high He s a brilliant player Could win majors And he s up 15 40 with two points for a double break and he only needs one Hurkacz goes long on the forehand with the rally barely under way and this first set is five to done A poor volley rescued by a gibongous ace confiscates Hurkacz s first break point Draper serves out from there and he s enjoying himself as you d expect given his 3 1 lead Sinner breaks Sonego then consolidates and already I think I should ve backed him to win in three not just to win as part of the acca I need to put on so I can watch all the matches I need to He leads 3 1 Wang leads Boulter 3 2 and for the first time Draper is under a bit of pressure serving at deuce On the topic of Draper here s Calv Betton He s serious Been groomed to be a winner all his life and when you practise with him he s serious as hell then completely changes personality when it s finished And he s a massive lefty too Those are some very significant raw materials A fine backhand cross court gives Draper a point for a double break Hurkacz responds with a service winner then closes out to get on the board at 1 2 down Draper consolidates for 2 0 and Zverev breaks Altmaier off the bat Wang meanwhile breaks Boulter for 2 1 and looks to have the greater ability to hit winners Bouler and Wang both hold likewise Sonego and Sinner but the latter makes the former fight for it Sinner is one of very few players who gives Carlos Alcaraz aggro and the two are if I m reading the bracket correctly scheduled to meet in the last eight I d lap that up Draper is I m told a proper killer and he s bang into stride from the off he looks to have shaken off the shoulder injury that derailed the early part of his summer absolutely cracking his forehand to make 0 30 on the Hurkacz serve Hurkacz though makes 40 30 only to net a backhand and shortly afterwards Draper has advantage He wafts a return inviting Hurkacz to supply his own pace and the riposte sails long That s the break at the first time of asking We learn that Hurkacz is a sound lad which is always good to hear His ability on the backhand might compromise Draper s swinging lefty serve out to that flank but it s rare he faces someone with as much power so will expect a battle I m watching Draper v Hurkacz Sonego v Sinner and Boulter v Wang When my daughter returns my laptop I ll also dig into Zverev v Almaier Our players are on their various courts I also enjoyed this from an interview he gave to the ATP website What s your favourite fruit I really like strawberries I think they taste great I m properly buzzing to see how Draper goes against Hurkacz Hubie as he likes to be known according to Wikipedia has a great love of gerbils and owns several hundred specimens on his ranch near Krakow He also has several dachschunds but he keeps them well away from the gerbils whenever possible Citation needed Yo dudes and welcome to the US Open 2023 day four We begin with a British triple header each match extremely tasty Kicking us off Katie Boulter in the form of her life meets Wang Yafan and at the same time the returning and extremely promising Jack Draper faces Hubert Hurkacz the number 17 seed Then when Ashe gets under way an hour later the resurgent Andrew Murray faces the resurgent Griggzy Dimitrov not bad eh and that s just us getting started For today s day sesh also features Cameron Norrie Dan Evans Maddison Keys Ons Jabeur Mario Berrettini Tom s Mart n Etcheverry v Stan Wawrinka Lorenzo Sonego v Jannik Sinner Jodie Burrage v Aryna Sabalenka Elina Svitolina v Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova Gael Monfils v Andrey Rublev and plenty more besides Frankly it s ridiculous So stick with us because this is going to be a lot of fun Let s go dudes  Andy Murray was comfortably beaten by Grigor Dimitrov while Jack Draper Katie Boulter and Cameron Norrie kept British hopes alive|14.0|14.0

Yang as we wrap up the blog for today Thank you for following along Climate crisis advocacy organizations are speaking out against major oil corporations following Hurricane Idalia s devastating destruction As we Floridians face the devastation of yet another massive hurricane we know exactly who is responsible for making these countless disasters exponentially worse the Big Oil CEOs profiting off the climate crisis and their political allies said Yoca Arditi Rocha executive director of the CLEO Institute in Florida Big Oil CEOs and politicians like Ron Desantis must be held accountable for knowingly fuelling the climate crisis that heats our oceans and strengthens deadly storms then leading the fight to strip away resources our state could use to respond she added John Paul Mejia a Miami native and national spokesperson for the Sunrise Movement echoed similar sentiments saying By turning down millions of dollars in climate investments while people suffer Governor DeSantis has shown he s more willing to shield Big Oil Executives from accountability than serve the people of Florida My generation won t forget this and we will do anything in our power to defeat politicians like him Similarly Jamie Henn of Fossil Free Media said Big Oil executives are sitting in cushy corner offices making massive profits while people in Florida Hawaii and all over the world are losing their homes businesses and lives Finally holding this industry accountable for the damage they re causing has become a major priority for the global climate movement As Floridians begin

federal funding available to the survivors and communities of Citrus Dixie Hamilton Lafayette Levy Suwannee and Taylor counties Here is drone footage depicting the scale of destruction in the aftermath of Hurricane Idalia in Florida We re just getting the initial assessments that the greatest concern right now is flooding and the impact on people s homes and businesses of that flooding Sherwood Randall said It currently doesn t look from aerial surveillance as if there has been widespread destruction of many buildings Some homes have been harmed some businesses have been harmed but principally it looks like it s about flooding in areas that are low lying where there was storm surge in the Big Bend in Florida and so that that will likely be the area in which we have to invest the most in recovery she added We have submitted to Congress a supplemental request that would replenish the Disaster Relief Fund because that fund has been depleted We have requested 12 billion because we know that every American expects FEMA to be there if they re experiencing a disaster Sherwood Randall said The US Army Corps of Engineers was pre positioned before the storm to support power restoration and brought in over 30 large generators that are pre staged if needed to support critical infrastructure such as hospitals and water treatment plants US Homeland Security advisor Elizabeth Sherwood Randall said in a White House press briefing on Thursday We will be with the citizens of these impacted states as long as it takes Sherwood Randall added White House press secretary Karine

Carolina and it may not be letting up any time soon The Weather Channel senior meteorologist Jonathan Erdman says There could be more high tide flooding this evening and tomorrow morning in parts of Virginia and in North Carolina s Outer Banks That s due to the combination of high tides and north east winds pushing water that way Like Georgia and the Carolinas parts of Florida are also suffering

Idalia and its aftermath Officials in those really hard hit counties I think did a good job he said Citizens responded very appropriately and then to be here where you have a storm hitting close to 130mph just under category 4 and not as of now have any reported fatalities it s probably something that most people would not have bet on four or five days ago Unofficially three deaths are being linked to the storm two motorists in Florida and a man trying to clear a felled tree in Georgia DeSantis will tour the worst affected areas today with Deanne Criswell administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency Fema I m here to see first hand the impacts that the communities have had so we can determine what level of assistance and what other programs we ll need to bring in to

13|UK scientists find link between proteins related to blood clots and long Covid Scientists have identified molecular signatures in the blood that are linked to brain fog other cognitive problems and fatigue in patients who are diagnosed with long Covid after catching the virus Raised levels of two different proteins were more common in people who developed long Covid symptoms that affected their brains the researchers found Both are hallmarks of blood clots in the body the likely cause of the symptoms reported The work described as an important step forward by one independent expert bolsters thinking that emerged at the height of the pandemic that Covid leaves some patients with tiny clots in their lungs and potentially in their brains leading to a wide range of long term memory concentration and thinking problems The findings could prove useful if clinical trials such as Stimulate ICP which are testing a range of treatments for long Covid conclude that anticoagulants can improve brain fog and fatigue in some patients Testing patients blood protein levels could alert doctors to those who should be treated for clots early and those who are less at risk The researchers looked at blood proteins in more than 1 800 hospitalised Covid patients and found that at the time of infection those who went on to develop long lasting cognitive problems were more likely than others to have raised levels of a protein called fibrinogen or a protein fragment called D dimer High levels of fibrinogen are a sign of blood clots in the body According to Max Taquet an author on the study at the University of Oxford patients could have blood clots on the brain that cause cognitive problems or fibrinogen itself could be affecting the brain Raised levels of D dimer also signify blood clots in the body but patients with high concentrations of the protein also tended to have post Covid fatigue and breathlessness leading the researchers to suspect blood clots on the lungs which can reduce blood flow to the brain and also cause fatigue Individuals with elevated D dimer levels were not only more prone to brain fog but also displayed a heightened risk of respiratory challenges Taquet said Danny Altmann a professor of immunology at Imperial College London and a leading long Covid expert said This is an important step forward in our understanding of the stratification of Long Covid and potentially some of the underlying mechanisms they argue the case in support of possible input from effects on clotting pathways While a blood test to look for raised levels of the proteins could help doctors flag Covid patients most likely to develop brain fog and other long Covid symptoms the biomarkers will not spot all patients at risk Real care is needed said Dr Michael Zandi at UCL s Queen Square Institute of Neurology The associations do not give us yet a clear one size fits all mechanism and treatments need to pass through rigorous clinical trial first The work reported in Nature Medicine comes as health officials in England raised concerns over a new highly mutated variant of Covid that has been detected in the UK and several other countries The UK has entered a period of very lightweight mitigations with a very narrowed booster rollout Altmann said Large cohort studies remind us what a gamble we face when getting infected by this virus We accrued more than 700 000 new long Covid cases during the period of mild Omicron infections Chris Brightling professor of respiratory medicine at the University of Leicester and a co author on the latest study said he feared long Covid patients might not receive the attention they need What I m still disappointed in is that there are still a lot of patients that are suffering who haven t fully recovered and we don t know how long it will take for them to recover or whether they will need treatment We are now in a situation where Covid is in competition with all the other needs of the healthcare system meaning there s a risk patients with long Covid will not have the attention that is required because this is a condition that is still not going away Altman added Most patients feel they have less and less support and negligible access to any treatment options  Biomarker discovery indicates that sufferers from brain fog and fatigue post virus could be treated with anticoagulants|1.0|0.0

15|Southgate defends decision to select Jordan Henderson in England squad Gareth Southgate has said there was no footballing reason to exclude Jordan Henderson from his England squad and the morality of the midfielder s decision to join Al Ettifaq in the Saudi Pro League was not a consideration for him Southgate sparked the usual discussions with his selection for England s upcoming matches the Euro 2024 qualifier against Ukraine in Poland a week on Saturday and the friendly against Scotland in Glasgow three days later The manager did not pick Raheem Sterling despite the forward s improved form for Chelsea in the early stages of the season which he admitted had gone down predictably badly with one of his most experienced players There were first call ups for Levi Colwill and Eddie Nketiah recalls for Ben Chilwell and Fikayo Tomori and continued faith in Harry Maguire and Kalvin Phillips despite their lack of football at club level Southgate calmly explained his reasons for overlooking Sterling who missed the Euro qualifiers against Italy and Ukraine in March through injury and those against Malta and North Macedonia in June after making himself unavailable Southgate said there was no room for the Chelsea player because of the form of Bukayo Saka Jack Grealish Marcus Rashford Phil Foden and James Maddison To add further options in wide areas he said stood to create problems But Southgate lacked his trademark composure when he was grilled over Henderson who dismayed gay rights groups with his move to Saudi Arabia where homosexuality is illegal and punishable by death Henderson had been a vocal supporter of the gay community during his time at Liverpool I don t really know what the morality argument is because so many of our industries are wrapped up with Saudi investment Southgate said Given the situation with Russia we are reliant on Saudi Arabia for a lot of our oil They re invested in so many British industries but I don t hear any noises about that It s only the football that s highlighted The LGBT stance is a religious belief in that country It s very difficult to work through all that so until somebody tells me differently on whether I can or can t pick players if they re playing in different countries My job is to pick a football team I don t think you can pick a football team based on any prejudice about where they might be playing their football I am a bit lost with some of the questioning You walk in to talk about a squad for football and we are wading into complex political situations which I am not really trained to do We will do the best we can Southgate has watched videos of Henderson s three Al Ettifaq games so far He will base his selection of him on what he sees on the pitch and a clearer understanding of the level and intensity of the league When Jordan phoned me about the likelihood he might be going there we had an honest conversation Southgate said I said We re going to have to map you against players playing in a different league and in a different level of competition and we re just going to have to see how that goes I think he realises that by making the decision he has made that is going to bring a certain level of scrutiny and criticism I don t think he s naive enough to think that wouldn t be the case They re questions he s going to have to answer I d be pretty certain that his views on life haven t changed at all Southgate was asked whether he would take a job in Saudi I can easily say no and look like the big guy he said But can you answer that question until it is there in front of you I m not looking to leave the job I m in Nor did Southgate avoid another of the elephants in the room the eye watering salaries on offer in Saudi Henderson has signed a two year deal with the option of a third year which is worth 700 000 a week He was on 200 000 a week at Liverpool before tax Any career decision has got a lot of different factors within it said Southgate Obviously there is a lot of money within Saudi Arabia that is being paid none of us are going to avoid that because it s obvious But Jordan s prospects of playing at Liverpool were probably a big factor in that becoming more attractive than it might have been in the past On Sterling Southgate noted that the player s decision to miss the June programme to focus on his fitness after a difficult season had paid dividends in the early weeks of this campaign That said it also allowed his rivals for selection to cement their places Raheem was not available for the last two get togethers and that has given other people the opportunity to play well and establish themselves in the group Southgate said It is a difficult call and Raheem is not particularly happy about it but he is an excellent player Raheem is always really respectful with how he responds and deals with things He will always say I respect your decision but of course he wants to get back in Southgate said that his omission of an in form Sterling ought not to be conflated with his selections of Maguire and Phillips who have yet to play a minute of football this season because there were different levels of competition in different areas of his squad Maguire he said was his only available experienced centre half Southgate has injury problems in defence where John Stones Tyrone Mings Luke Shaw and Reece James are out Mason Mount is missing through injury in midfield  Gareth Southgate has said there was no footballing reason to exclude Jordan Henderson from his England squad after his decision to join Al

18|Alice Capsey and Mahika Gaur lead England past Sri Lanka in rain hit T20 England s late summer series against Sri Lanka has been billed as a chance for their young players to shine if the opening T20 was anything to go by that is proving an accurate summation The captain Heather Knight eventually made it out to the middle after bumping herself down the order to No 5 but her role was largely reduced to watcher in chief only 15 runs in her partnership of 56 with Alice Capsey came off the bat of Knight The 19 year old Capsey of course is England s future as she proved in the Ashes earlier this summer and as she proved again here on a chilly evening in Hove smashing a 26 ball half century her third in an England shirt Sri Lanka s left arm spinner Inoka Ranaweera felt the sharp end 22 runs off her third over including three sixes hammered over the leg side into the depths of the crowd I ve been given the freedom to go out there and play my way and I feel pretty settled in this group Capsey said It s refreshing going from series to series going into different teams and bouncing off different people s energy England are resting Nat Sciver Brunt and Sophia Dunkley for this series but with Capsey supported by 48 quickfire runs from Danni Wyatt and a blistering 20 off 10 balls from the 18 year old Freya Kemp they easily reached the heights of 186 for four despite the match being reduced to 17 overs a side We re missing a few big names out of our squad so it s nice for players who have performed in regional cricket to come and get their opportunity to be a part of the England environment and see what it s about Capsey said We have got huge depth in English cricket now With Lauren Bell sitting out the first two matches of the series due to illness there was also the opportunity for the 17 year old Mahika Gaur who previously represented the United Arab Emirates to try to find her feet in ICC full member international cricket Left arm seamers with the natural advantage of being 6ft 2in tall do not come along every day in the women s game Gaur s debut had thus been more widely billed then most There have been more memorable opening overs in international cricket this one began with a leg side wide and ended with an unsuccessful DRS review for lbw against Vishmi Gunaratne and when the players were forced from the field due to further rain it looked like Gaur might have to wait another day to make amends Forty minutes later though she was handed a second chance play resumed with Sri Lanka needing to hit a DLS adjusted 45 runs from 17 balls Facing up to the Sri Lankan captain Chamari Athapaththu Gaur got just enough away swing to take her edge behind the stumps Amy Jones did the rest and the 17 year old had a pretty decent maiden scalp to her name Two overs later despite three successive boundaries off Kate Cross at the hands of Nilakshi de Silva England could at last celebrate a 12 run win via DLS It was closer than they might have liked but a win nonetheless amid all the chaos of rain Earlier play had finally got under way at Hove an hour late after persistent wet weather throughout the day Wyatt continued where she had left off in The Hundred final on Sunday sending the second ball of the innings crashing through the covers for four before rocking back and pulling hard over the leg side field for six more Although the Sri Lanka bowler Kavisha Dilhari pulled off a brilliant direct hit run out to see off Maia Bouchier to break the 77 run opening stand the tone for England s dominant performance had been set  Alice Capsey smashed a 26 ball half century for England in their 12 run T20 win over Sri Lanka on the DLS method after a rain interrupted opener|14.0|14.0
19|Nadine Dorries book on Boris Johnson s downfall delayed due to legal issues Nadine Dorries book on the downfall of Boris Johnson will be delayed until November because of the required legal process the publisher has said The former culture secretary who resigned as an MP last weekend has been writing a book on her staunch ally which had been scheduled for release on 28 September just before the Conservative party conference in Manchester It will now be released on 9 November HarperCollins said The publisher said a small delay is necessary to allow for the huge volume of material the author has consulted the number of high level sources spoken to and the required legal process needed to share her story HarperCollins has described Dorries book as a seismic fly on the wall account of how the saviour of the Conservative party became a pariah and will feature unparalleled access from multiple inside sources talking with astonishing candour The former MP for Mid Bedfordshire who received 20 500 as a partial advance from HarperCollins for The Plot the Political Assassination of Boris Johnson said What began as an investigation into how Boris Johnson was removed from office ultimately revealed a corruption of democracy deep at the heart of the Conservative party and in Downing Street Secrecy fear and the cloak of anonymity have protected those who wield power in the shadows until now It makes The House of Cards appear tame but this is no made up tale it s for real and for the first time their political dark arts are about to be revealed Dorries resigned last Saturday two and a half months after first announcing her intention to step down as an MP in protest at not receiving a peerage in Johnson s resignation honours list She has previously accused Rishi Sunak of duplicitously and cruelly blocking her from getting a peerage Her announcement last Saturday came with a scathing attack on Sunak in which she claimed the prime minister presided over a zombie parliament She also accused the Tory leader of abandoning the fundamental principles of Conservatism telling him History will not judge you kindly Dorries who was elected as an MP in May 2005 added What exactly has been done or have you Sunak achieved You hold the office of prime minister unelected without a single vote not even from your own MPs You have no mandate from the people and the government is adrift You have squandered the goodwill of the nation for what Her resignation paves the way for another potentially awkward byelection for the Conservatives in what should be an ultra safe Tory seat In 2019 Dorries won the seat with a 24 664 majority over Labour However Sunak s party is still reeling from the loss to Labour of Selby and Ainsty in North Yorkshire in a byelection in July In that contest Labour overturned a Tory majority of just over 20 000 suggesting that even the safest seats are now vulnerable  Ex MP claims her account will lay bare a corruption of democracy deep at the heart of the Conservative party and in Downing Street |3.0|3.0
20|Andrew Tate The Man Who Groomed the World review the revelations in this excellent expos are a major coup According to conventional logic Andrew Tate the Anglo American kickboxer turned public misogynist currently awaiting trial in Romania on charges of rape and human trafficking should not be this famous How did a man whose biggest claim to fame before TikTok remains a six day stint on the 2016 series of Big Brother become one of the world s most Googled people That s the mystery no one has figured out says investigative reporter Matt Shea at the start of his second BBC documentary on Tate which is a bit strange considering he already told us how he did it minutes into his first film The Dangerous Rise of Andrew Tate which was screened in February Alongside extensive interviews with Tate and women who claim to have been abused by him Shea explains that the money making courses Tate flogs online using his bombastic personality and glitzy lifestyle double as an affiliate marketing scheme Subscribers flood social media with videos of Tate saying wildly sexist things using the attention generated to convince others to sign up to his virtual school if new subscribers use their link they get 48 of the fee In other words Tate has created his own promotional army That s why Tate is everywhere What Shea is trying to do in his follow up film Andrew Tate The Man Who Groomed the World is find out who helped Tate orchestrate this It s a less flashy premise but an incredibly important one especially when the business in question is so nefarious Shea homes in on the War Room the most expensive tier of Tate s online school and using 12 000 pages of internal chats supplied by a helpful internet sleuth in what looks like a real coup reports that members are encouraged or even pressured to lure women into lucrative sex work and then take all their earnings Shea manages to track down two of the women mentioned in the messages and they provide extensive corroborative details Tate s ethos is not a return to old school patriarchal ideals where women submit and men provide this model of appallingly exploitative misogyny sees women submit and provide too Continually juxtaposed with these infuriating and disturbing revelations is the so called humour Tate deals in Since the first documentary was released Tate has been obsessively mocking the superficially nervy but courageous journalist in his content producing DNG Dork Nerd Geek T shirts with Shea s picture on them and ensuring that Shea receives a personal email each time one is purchased It s not the only bit of wearisome banter on which Tate fixates when Shea travels to Bucharest in an attempt to interview him again he is under house arrest Tate says he will only oblige if Shea presents him with a box of chocolates a power play his followers are advised to use to ascertain whether a woman is easily manipulated Tate delights in rejecting Shea s dogged advances and you can t help but wish the reporter would stop giving him the satisfaction His repeated attempts to quiz Tate demonstrate that the production has been scrupulous in giving him the right to reply to some extremely serious allegations but as material it seems a waste of time at this point Tate s internet presence and the women s testimony tell you all you need to know about the man Especially considering his modus operandi in previous interviews has been to adopt a faux reasonable persona to argue his way out of the allegation that he is promoting violent misogyny or take on the guise of an irony saturated troll leaving the promise of meaningful dialogue slipping like sand through a reporter s fingers Much more satisfying is the fact that Shea manages to pin down a key accomplice of Tate s who has been flying firmly under the radar a sixtysomething American known as Iggy Semmelweis self styled spiritual leader and greatest hypnotist in the world This documentary suggests that Semmelweis is the real mastermind of the War Room and used Tate already a notorious misogynist who ran a business streaming sex shows as a figurehead for his own enterprise It s impossible to believe the egomaniacal and sometimes scarily messianic Tate is anyone s stooge However the leaked chat log suggests Semmelweis is particularly intent on getting War Room members to procure women for sex work We also hear from a family connection who claims that he has a long established involvement in cults and according to Eli a former War Room member who worked as head of sales and marketing for Tate treats the business like one too employees are advised to cut ties with loved ones Unlike Tate Semmelweis doesn t seem to be after fame or money and appears to live modestly in Los Angeles So what is his agenda Shea asks To take over the world I guess Eli the former member replies matter of factly Considering one statistic revealed in the film in the UK 52 of boys aged 16 to 17 have a positive view of Tate this nightmarish vision of the future isn t as far fetched as it sounds But it s also one that Shea s excellent expos has made just a little less likely Andrew Tate The Man Who Groomed the World was shown on BBC Three and is available on iPlayer  Investigative reporter Matt Shea s second film about the misogynistic influencer is a dogged disturbing occasionally infuriating watch But it contains important new claims|16.0|7.0
21|Andy Murray admits grand slam deep runs may be over after US Open exit Andy Murray said that he may need to accept that the deep runs he believes he is still capable of may not actually happen after he suffered one of his most disappointing defeats of the year losing 6 3 6 4 6 1 in the second round of the US Open to Grigor Dimitrov the 19th seed at Arthur Ashe Stadium Maybe I need to accept that at these events the deep runs and everything that I felt like I m capable of they might not be there as well he said I m aware what I m doing it s unbelievably challenging to play at the highest level as I am now And some days it s harder than others he added Despite pushing some top 10 opponents to the limit and compiling a 3 3 record against players ranked between 11 and 20 this year the Scot has not been able to reach the later stages at any Masters 1000 or grand slam tournaments Murray performed immensely in Australia defeating Matteo Berrettini en route to the third round of the Australian Open and then he forced Stefanos Tsitsipas the fifth seed to an excellent five set battle in their second round match at Wimbledon But Murray is yet to reach the fourth round of a major since his hip problems began in 2017 Today is obviously a really disappointing defeat and probably the manner of it as well he said I mean I fought hard enough but just didn t play well enough Ultimately these are the events that you want to play your best tennis in and create more great moments and I didn t do that this year Despite the congeniality between Murray and Dimitrov it was a match that came with some added spice Dimitrov now works with two of Murray s former coaches Dani Vallverd Murray s old friend and Jamie Delgado who Murray worked with until 2021 Before the match a smile flickered across Murray s face as he noted that it probably was an advantage for Dimitrov to have them in his corner but the match would be won on the court In the early stages of a ballistic first set the contest had all the ingredients of a brutal physical battle After trailing 2 0 Murray broke back after an astonishing 15 minute game that included dazzling all court rallies and six deuces After 47 minutes only five games had been played But those tight early games eventually made way for a more one sided contest Throughout the match Murray struggled to impose his game and hit through the conditions along with Dimitrov s excellent backhand slice and defence Dimitrov took the decisive break of the first set after a dire service game from Murray which included two double faults and two service games and he was soon up a set and a break after another poor game on serve from Murray to open the second set A potential turning point came for Murray as Dimitrov served with the break at 4 3 in the second set the Bulgarian double faulting twice to offer Murray a break point The long 33 stroke rally that followed on break point illustrated Murray s problems as he dictated most of the action but simply could not hit through the court and conditions Dimitrov survived the service game he served out the set and went from strength to strength as he sealed the lengthy physical match in three sets Murray said he simply did not play well enough I think I got broken at the beginning of every set so could never sort of get any scoreboard pressure really Then the times when I did sort of get back into sets or sort of break back I just didn t play well enough Didn t serve well enough Asked what keeps him motivated after not making as much progress as he hoped to make the 36 year old said that he has continued to feel like he is still making progress It is a feeling backed up by his ranking which is currently No 37 and continues to gradually rise Murray also noted his positive matches in Australia and how he felt he was close to having a good run at Wimbledon I still enjoy everything that goes into playing at a high level he said I enjoy the work The training and trying to improve and trying to get better I do still enjoy that And that s what keeps me going If things change and I stop enjoying that or my results my ranking and everything like if I start to go backwards in that respect and in a few months time I was ranked 60 in the world or whatever instead of moving up things might change Elsewhere the 38 year old former US No 1 John Isner ended his singles career on Thursday as he was unable to close out a two set lead eventually losing 3 6 4 6 7 6 3 6 4 7 6 7 to fellow American wildcard Michael Mmoh  Andy Murray said he may need to accept his deep grand slam runs may be over after losing 6 3 6 4 6 1 to Grigor Dimitrov in the US Open second round|14.0|14.0
22|England beat Sri Lanka by 12 runs in rain hit first women s T20 as it happened Raf Nicholson s report should be here soon I m going to call it a night Thanks for checking in Alice Capsey no surprises is the Player of the Match Odd game that in the end England smashed it to all parts during their 17 overs Alice Capsey top scoring with 51 off 27 balls to take the hosts to an imposing total of 186 4 Sri Lanka got their reply underway but the rain intervened to turn this into a six over game There weren t too many scares for England as they closed out the game pretty comfortably even with de Silva s three consecutive fours in that final over On we go to the next T20I at Chelmsford on Saturday De Silva swings across the line to pick up four off Kate Cross and then a full toss is carved over point for four more Game on De Silva then advances down the pitch to drive through extra cover for another boundary that s three on the bounce A pull shot brings one before a wide follows Gunaratne picks up three to give de Silva one more hit And there s a run out shout as de Silva wants to scamper for a quick single before tuning back and after several replays she s given out her bat still in the air That s that England go 1 0 up in this three match T20I series 5th over Sri Lanka 38 2 de Silva 5 Gunaratne Nilakshi de Silva emerges but the game is pretty much gone now as Dean runs through the rest of her over Sri Lanka need 30 from six balls Another one falls Hasini Perera the new batter tries to sweep Charlie Dean but misses out and that s plumb Sri Lanka review but it s wasted Sri Lanka need to go all guns blazing and Gunaratne begins by running two Athapaththu then gets on strike and immediately launches Gaur over wide long on for six It was full from Gaur and a beautiful swing of the bat from Athapaththu Gaur responds with a sharp bouncer and then a wicket Athapaththu swings hard across the line but can only land an edge that finds Jones behind the stumps 4th over Sri Lanka 32 1 Gunaratne 13 Sri Lanka need 36 from 12 balls We re getting back out there now for a 9 29pm re start Mahika Gaur s got the ball Charles Dagnall on comms says it s drizzling again OK we re gonna have a six over game Sri Lanka need 45 runs in 17 balls a tough ask The umps have been out there doing the rounds Still no news on what s happening Looks like the covers are coming off so maybe we do still have a game on here We ve had 3 1 overs of the Sri Lanka innings so 11 more balls are required to ensure a result The view from the ground Not pretty The rain is getting noticeable heavier and the players are heading off Ugh 3rd over Sri Lanka 23 0 Gunaratne 10 Athapaththu 9 Danielle Gibson takes over from the other end and Athapaththu is off the mark with a boundary Then there s a bit of fortune from the left hander as she goes for a big swing a thick edge flying to the third man boundary for four more 2nd over Sri Lanka 12 0 Athapaththu 0 Gunaratne 9 Now this is exciting here comes 17 year old Mahika Gaur Not an ideal start as a leg side wide beats Amy Jones fingertips and Sri Lanka collect three And then a great riposte swinging in to the right hander and an lbw shout but it s a touch high Gunaratne then goes for a full blooded swipe but misses out Some decent movement for Gaur Gunaratne tucks into the next delivery though driving an overpitched ball through point for four Knight opts for a review thinking there s a little tickle off the bat down the leg side on the way to Jones but no dice And the rain begins to fall 1st over Sri Lanka 5 0 Gunaratne 5 Athapaththu 0 Lovely timing from Gunaratne as Cross goes a touch too wide punching off the backfoot through point for four This is a comeback of sorts for Cross her first T20I since December 2019 and she bowls a tighter line to the left handed Athapaththu Kate Cross will open up for England let s play As mentioned earlier Alice Capsey s rather special 17th over England 186 4 Knight 23 Jones 4 Prabodhani s left arm seam will close out the innings and Knight greets her with a powerful straight drive for four A wide follows that evades the keeper and runs all the way to the boundary It s quiet after that but England have made more than enough noise going at close to 11 an over 16th over England 171 4 Knight 16 Jones 1 With one over to go Knight has Amy Jones alongside her for a final smash Knight reverse sweeps Athapaththu past backward point for four but when Capsey tries the same shot she s bowled Oh well that was still some knock from the teenager 15th over England 162 3 Knight 8 Capsey 51 Sri Lanka waste a review before Knight thumps Prabodhani over mid off for four She s watched Capsey smack it about now she wants some of that for herself Capsey then gets a full toss that she slaps away to the leg side to move to 47 And then another boundary to close the over taking Capsey to a half century off just 26 balls She s a special special talent 14th over England 145 3 Capsey 42 Knight 2 Capsey tries a funky reverse swat off Ranaweera s left arm spin but fails to make contact She makes up for it the very next ball with a dance down the pitch and an almighty smack over deep midwicket for six And then she repeats the trick this time staying in her crease for the big ol slog sweep A front foot no ball is up next before Capsey hits her third six of the over again over deep midwicket A full toss follows and Capsey is probably annoyed with herself for not making it four 13th over England 123 3 Capsey 21 Knight 2 The boundaries resume as Capsey slogs Athapaththu to wide long on for four 12th over England 116 3 Capsey 15 Knight 1 Quality work from Dilhari as Heather Knight joins Capsey out in the middle Dilhari strikes with a smart bit of bowling launching one flat and wide as Kemp advances out of her crease but loses all shape reaching for the ball The keeper does the rest as Kemp tumbles onto the ground 11th over England 112 2 Capsey 13 Kemp 20 Kemp goes big slog sweeping Kumari for six over midwicket And then Kemp goes down the pitch and it s dropped at long off with the ball then bobbling away for four Kemp s fine over continues with a flick behind square on the leg side that runs away for another boundary Some numbers for ya 10th over England 94 2 Kemp 3 Capsey 12 Dilhari s very much in this game darting the ball in and racing across the turf any time she needs to field off her bowling But Capsey still finds a way to the boundary cutting through point off the final ball of the over 9th over England 86 2 Capsey 6 Kemp 1 Good fun was that Wyatt innings but she would ve been eyeing up a really big one Instead it s now Freya Kemp out there with Capsey Sri Lanka are beginning to find their way in this game Ranaweera continues and strikes It s Wyatt who goes now She backs away to the leg side to try and drive through off but makes no contact and the ball rattles the stumps 8th over England 82 1 Wyatt 47 Capsey 4 Good over from Dilhari who s unlucky to concede a boundary from the final ball Alice Capsey sees flight and goes for the drive outside off with an outside edge running away for four The bowling changes keep on coming for Sri Lanka with Kavisha Dilhari coming on to bowl her tweakers She starts well bowling with accuracy and then a quality bit of work in the field Dilhari fields off her own bowling picking up at short mid on before launching a throw at the non striker s stumps to run out Bouchier Just the one stump to aim at and she nailed it 7th over England 75 0 Bouchier 21 Wyatt 46 Inoka Ranaweera s left arm spin enters the game and now it s Bouchier s turn she gets on one knee and sweeps hard all the way for six Meanwhile bit random but there s a cardboard cutout of Roger Daltrey at Hove that s got Butch chuckling 6th over England 66 0 Bouchier 13 Wyatt 45 Prabodhani s left arm seam returns and Wyatt s fun continues she drives hard at a wider one and finds the gap behind point to move to 40 A direct hit at the stumps leads to overthrows to the boundary making life even tougher for Sri Lanka 5th over England 55 0 Bouchier 11 Wyatt 36 Athapaththu continues and tosses one up wide outside off and the unstoppable Wyatt thwacks through the covers for another boundary her sixth four of the innings 4th over England 50 0 Wyatt 32 Bouchier 11 Right arm quick Kawya Kavindi steps into the attack and begins with a wide A full toss is then dispatched by Wyatt to midwicket for another four A good comeback from Kavindi though as she swings and nips the ball away from Wyatt s attempted drive A bouncer follows before Wyatt cuts over point to move into the thirties A leg side wide is up next before the next ball flies even wider down leg past the keeper and to the boundary Tough first over this for the 20 year old playing just her fifth T20I Bouchier picks up two to get England to 50 in no time 3rd over England 32 0 Wyatt 23 Bouchier 9 Athapaththu brings herself on to calm things down with some offies and does just that conceding only four 2nd over England 28 0 Bouchier 6 Wyatt 22 Left arm spinner Sugandika Kumari takes over from the other end and drags one down Wyatt punishes it with a pull for a one bounce four Kumari then goes short again two balls later this time Wyatt sends it all the way for six easy as you like Better from Kumari as she fizzes one through but Wyatt still manages to get out a late cut the ball travelling for another boundary Rapid start from Wyatt and England 1st over England 12 0 Wyatt 6 Bouchier 6 Left arm seamer Udeshika Prabodhani takes the new ball and gets a bit of early swing Bouchier knocks through midwicket for a single to start Wyatt gets a full toss and drives through the covers for four tidy Three singles follow before Bouchier stretches out to loft the ball down the ground for her first boundary Right then Sri Lanka are out there as are Danni Wyatt and Maia Bouchier Let s play Some other news

movement of the covers with an inspection scheduled for 6pm Naturally there s quite a bit of attention on Mahika Gaur Worth noting that her England debut won t be her international one she played for the UAE as a 12 year old Twelve Twelve Doesn t really relate to Gaur but this video still comes to mind Ugh hopefully it clears up Anyway the pundits Butcher Beaumont and Greenway have been singing the praises of Danni Wyatt who was England s leading run scorer in the Ashes T20Is and then had an excellent Hundred too She was class in the final So Tammy Beaumont s on punditry duties for Sky She s certainly got a strong case to be in the playing XI today having had a terrific summer for England in other forms before smashing a historic ton in The Hundred for Welsh Fire By the way the toss has been delayed Looking rather gloomy at Hove with a bit of light rain in the air ICYMI this series also marks another beginning England s women will now be paid the same as the men when it comes to

Gaur just 17 is a tall left arm quick who has been picked on raw promise while Bess Heath the 22 year old batter for Northern Diamonds is capable of giving the ball a more than decent whack in the middle order Both are uncapped both are in for the two legs of Sri Lanka s visit With Dunkley away Maia Bouchier will step up to partner Danni Wyatt at the top of the order in these T20Is and she s been hitting them well 268 runs at 38 28 while striking at 135 helped Southern Brave to Hundred glory after their two previous runners up finishes It s not been the most gorgeous day at Hove and the

26|Trump s Georgia election subversion trial will be broadcast live on YouTube judge says as it happened Donald Trump will not be appearing in a Georgia courtroom for his arraignment next week instead deciding to enter his plea of not guilty in writing and skipping another trip to Atlanta Separately Republican governor Brian Kemp rejected an effort by a small group of rightwing lawmakers to call the state legislature back in session to remove Fani Willis the Fulton county district attorney who indicted Trump and 18 others for trying to overturn Georgia s elections in 2020 And next week we may get more details about the special grand jury whose work led to the indictments when their full report is potentially made public by a judge Here s what else happened today A self described organizer for the Proud Boys militia group was given a 17 year prison sentence for his actions on January 6 The Capitol physician said Mitch McConnell was medically clear to go back to work but some senators reportedly want to call a special caucus meeting to discuss his health issues Trump s attorney has filed to sever his case from the 18 other defendants in the Georgia election subversion case which could allow him to put off going to trial Clarence Thomas the conservative supreme court justice released his delayed financial disclosure reports in which he acknowledged more luxury trips taken with Republican mega donor Harlan Crow Trump remains way ahead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight com reports though his support may have slipped a little bit since the Georgia indictment Jenna Ellis a former attorney for Donald Trump who advised on ways to prevent Joe Biden from taking office has pled not guilty to charges brought against her in the Georgia election subversion case Reuters reports Once a prosecutor in Colorado Ellis spread multiple statements claiming voter fraud during the 2020 election and sent at least two memos advising Mike Pence to reject Biden s victory in Georgia and other states The Colorado supreme court censured Ellis earlier this year and she acknowledged making false statements Ellis was among the 19 people indicted by Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis last week along with Trump who today pleaded not guilty to charges including racketeering The editorial board of influential conservative publication National Review is calling on Mitch McConnell to step down as Republican leader in the Senate They cite the two instances of the 81 year old freezing up in public in recent months as evidence that it s time to hand leadership of the minority party to someone else though they do not call for him to resign his seat representing Kentucky Here s more from their piece The details can be left to McConnell who deserves a large measure of deference A leadership transition doesn t need to happen urgently but the wheels should be turning Stepping aside from leadership would not necessarily require leaving the Senate McConnell could like Nancy Pelosi remain in office and he would doubtless remain influential so long as he is capable of serving But the job of caucus leader demands more The time will come for a fuller appreciation of McConnell s legacy But his strenuous opposition to campaign finance reform effective resistance to the Obama agenda stalwart refusal to fill the Scalia seat prior to the 2016 election fruitful cooperation with President Trump on judges and lately strong support for American leadership abroad when the winds in the party are blowing the opposite way easily make him one of the most consequential politicians of our era Prudence and realism have been hallmarks of his leadership and now are called for in considering his own future Joe Biden s national infrastructure advisory council has recommended privatization and long term leases of water systems to help revitalise the nation s aging water infrastructure a move that has not gone down well with water justice advocates Nationwide one in 10 people already depend on private water companies whose bills are on average almost 60 higher than those supplied by public utilities Private ownership is the single largest factor associated with higher water bills more than aging infrastructure or climate disasters Water privatisation is a terrible idea said Mary Grant the Public Water for All campaign director at Food amp Water Watch Wall Street wants to take control of the nation s public water systems to wring profits from communities that are already struggling with unaffordable water bills and toxic water Privatisation would deepen the nation s water crises leading to higher water bills and less accountable and transparent services The council is also recommending the creation of a federal water department or an equivalent cabinet level agency to oversee a national strategy to shore up the nation s ageing water infrastructure Federal funding for water and wastewater peaked in 1977 since when utilities have mostly relied on loans and raising bills to fund infrastructure upgrades After decades of federal austerity for water the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act provided a major cash injection but is still just a fraction around 7 of what experts say is needed to provide safe clean affordable drinking water for every American Biden s advisory council includes public and private sector representatives but notably the chair is the CEO of Global Infrastructure Partners an infrastructure investment bank with an estimated 100bn in assets under management that targets energy transportation digital and water infrastructure Joe Biden just announced he will travel to Florida on Saturday to survey damage caused by Hurricane Idalia Earlier in the day the White House announced he spoke to Florida s Republican governor and 2024 presidential contender Ron DeSantis and signed a major disaster declaration that will steer federal resources to the state Biden and DeSantis are adversaries but have put politics aside to make joint appearances when Biden has traveled Florida state following disasters most recently in October in the aftermath of Hurricane Ian Now a tropical storm Idalia is menacing the Carolinas Follow our live blog for the latest on its path Punchbowl News reports that Capitol physician Brian Monahan says Mitch McConnell the top GOP lawmaker in the Senate who yesterday appeared to freeze up while addressing the press is medically clear to work Monahan attributed the episode the second in as many months to occasional lightheadedness as the Kentucky lawmaker continues to recover from a concussion he sustained earlier this year Meanwhile Joe Biden said he had spoken to McConnell and his former senate colleague was his old self on the telephone Here s a clip of the president s remarks Scott McAfee the judge presiding over the trials of Donald Trump and his 18 co defendants in the Georgia election subversion case says the proceedings will be streamed live on YouTube Atlanta News First reports McAfee cited the practice of Robert McBurney the judge who presided over the grand jury investigation and indictment phase of the case It s unclear when Trump s trial will start but proceedings in his former attorney Kenneth Chesebro s case are scheduled to start on 23 October Why does Donald Trump want his trial severed from two other his fellow co defendants Because those two defendants Kenneth Chesebro and Sidney Powell both former lawyers for his campaign have made motions for speedy trials which is exactly what Trump doesn t want In a sign of just how speedy those trials will be a judge set out a schedule for Chesebro s trial that will see it start on 23 October Politico reports that Trump s attorney Steven Sadow argues that if the former president is put on trial at the same time he won t have enough time to mount a proper defense In a fast moving and ever more complex situation lawyers for Donald Trump have moved to sever his election racketeering case in Georgia from two defendants who have asked for their own trials to be speeded up As local Georgia court journalist Sam Gringlas reports Trump moves to SEVER his case from 2 defendants who want a speedy trial slated for Oct We re in a huge state of flux right now attorney Bob Rubin told me The case involving these 19 defendants seems to be going in a lot of different directions all at the same time His fellow senators may be keeping mum but at least one Republican politics watcher thinks it s time for Mitch McConnell to step down the Guardian s Martin Pengelly reports It may be time for Mitch McConnell to pass the torch a leading Republican pollster said after the 81 year old GOP Senate leader suffered a second apparent freeze while talking to reporters It s one of the problems that we have with Washington which is that there is a time to lead and a time to pass on the torch to another generation Frank Luntz told CNN A spokesperson for McConnell said the senator felt light headed on Wednesday when he appeared to freeze during questions from reporters in Covington in his home state of Kentucky and was eventually escorted away McConnell would consult a doctor the spokesperson said But the freeze followed a similar incident in Washington in July when McConnell was speaking at the US Capitol He said then he had been sandbagged a reference to Joe Biden s fall at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado in May and returned to talk to reporters On Wednesday Biden called McConnell a good friend and said he would try and get in touch with him later this afternoon Tucker Carlson warns of Trump assassination Far right media personality Tucker Carlson is known for his outrageous statements and bigoted positions as well as a degree of paranoia They can mostly be found on social media these days after being taken off air by Fox News But even by his own low standards Carson might have gone too far on comedian Adam Corolla s podcast when he predicted that someone would try to kill Donald Trump the Hill reports Begin with criticism then you go to protest then you go to impeachment now you go to indictment and none of them work I mean what s next You know graph it out man We re speeding toward assassination obviously No one will say that but I don t know how you can t reach that conclusion Carlson said It s not the first time Carson has gone there though In a recent interview with Trump himself held to distract people from the Republican debate Carson asked bluntly Are you worried that they re going to try and kill you Why wouldn t they try and kill you Following the second instance in as many months where the Senate s top Republican Mitch McConnell froze up while addressing the press Politico reports that some senators want to convene a special meeting to discuss his health McConnell 81 is the longest serving party leader in Senate history but suffered a concussion earlier this year that he took weeks to recover from as well as a fall in July The Kentucky lawmaker was challenged for the party s leadership post earlier this year by Florida s senator Rick Scott but easily defeated him and it remains unclear if a majority of his fellow Republicans want him to step down Here s more from Politico Some rank and file Republicans have discussed the possibility of a broader conversation once senators return to Washington next week according to a person directly involved in the conversations who confirmed them on condition of anonymity Party leadership is not currently involved in those discussions and nothing has been decided yet this person added It takes just five Republican senators to force a special conference meeting which is the most direct way to have a specific discussion about the minority leader after his public pause on Wednesday revived questions about his condition But the Senate GOP also holds private lunches two or three times a week giving members another forum for hashing out the direction of the party s leadership one that could forestall the need for a special confab And McConnell s health is a touchy subject The 81 year old the longest serving party leader in Senate history doesn t like to discuss it Even detractors of the Kentucky Republican s leadership style are sensitive to the health issues he faces after falling in March and suffering a concussion Even so the question now facing the GOP is whether McConnell s health hastens a transition atop the conference leadership that has to happen eventually McConnell squashed his first ever challenge last fall from Sen Rick Scott R Fla on a 37 10 vote If a special conference meeting doesn t happen the issue could be punted until after the 2024 election However a special meeting would undoubtedly draw more media attention that would amplify the risk of specifically broaching the touchy topic of McConnell s leadership And his own support may be relatively unchanged even after the two summer pauses Donald Trump will not be appearing in a Georgia courtroom for his arraignment next week instead deciding to enter his plea of not guilty in writing and skip another trip to Atlanta Separately Republican governor Brian Kemp rejected an effort by a small group of rightwing lawmakers to call the state legislature back in session to remove Fani Willis the Fulton county district attorney who indicted Trump and 18 others for trying to overturn Georgia s elections in 2020 And next week we may get more details about the special grand jury whose work led to the indictments when their full report is potentially made public by a judge Here s what else has happened today so far A self described organizer for the Proud Boys militia group was just given a 17 year prison sentence for his actions on January 6 Clarence Thomas the conservative supreme court justice released his delayed financial disclosure reports in which he acknowledged luxury trips taken with Republican mega donor Harlan Crow Trump remains way ahead in the race for the Republican presidential nomination poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight reports though his support may have slipped a little bit since the Georgia indictment Joseph Biggs a self described organizer for the Proud Boys militia group who entered the Capitol on January 6 was just handed a 17 year jail sentence by a judge after being convicted on seditious conspiracy charges The term was much less than the 33 years prosecutors requested which would have been the highest meted out in the cases stemming from the attack on the Capitol Biggs is one of five Proud Boys scheduled to be sentenced in the coming days a group that also includes its former leader Enrique Tarrio A report produced by a special grand jury that Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis used to indict Donald Trump and 18 others for trying to overturn Georgia s election in 2020 could be released in full on 8 September the Atlanta Journal Constitution reports Judge Robert McBurney had earlier this year made public parts of the report but kept other sections sealed at the request of Willis who cited due process concerns In particular a chapter where jurors recommended who should be indicted was kept out of the public eye If it was released it could answer whether there were people who the jurors thought should face charges whom Willis ultimately did not indict McBurney said the due process concerns were alleviated by the announcement of charges in the case and said he would release the report next Friday unless any parties object Here s more from the Journal Constitution Such an exceedingly public development eliminates due process concerns at least for the 19 defendants charged in the case and who might have been named in the special grand jury s final report McBurney wrote For that reason he said he plans to release the final report at 10 a m on Sept 8 At the same time McBurney said if any concerned party believes something less than everything should be published they have until close of business on Sept 6 to raise an objection If objections are timely filed they will be carefully considered and a new publication date will be announced he said Objections would likely come from individuals who were not indicted but who may believe the special grand jury voted that they be charged They may want to keep such a recommendation from being made public When the full special grand jury s final report is published it will show the vote tallies from the 23 member panel on each recommendation as to who should be indicted grand jurors told The Atlanta Journal Constitution in prior interviews This will allow the public to know whether the panel was overwhelmingly in favor or closely divided on each person If you are wondering if Donald Trump s indictment in Georgia has changed his political fortunes poll aggregator FiveThirtyEight took a look at the numbers and the answer is no Looking at the big picture including FiveThirtyEight s averages of the national Republican primary and Trump s overall favorable and unfavorable ratings it s clear that public opinion about Trump has not changed in a major way in several months even after he was indicted on nearly 100 criminal charges in four different jurisdictions After what is expected to be his final indictment he remains the strong favorite in the GOP primary and a competitive candidate in the general election they write The conclusion comes in a piece that analyzes some of the more recent polls that have come out of Republican primary voters which show some fluctuations in Trump s level of support but no change to his status as the far and away frontrunner for the party s presidential nomination He s currently at 50 support in FiveThirty Eight s polling average down from 53 before news of the Georgia indictment broke but still an overwhelming advantage Here s the moment from his press conference today where Georgia governor Brian Kemp rejected using the legislature to oust Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis His remarks amounted to both a repudiation of the effort to stop her prosecution and a defense of her conduct Georgia s Republican governor Brian Kemp says he will not call the legislature into a special session to impeach Fani Willis the Fulton county district attorney who last week brought charges against Donald Trump and 18 others for trying to overturn the state s presidential election result in 2020 Atlanta s WSB TV reports A handful of GOP lawmakers have requested Kemp convene the legislature outside of their normal session to remove Willis from the case but the governor who has publicly rejected the former president s baseless insistence that Joe Biden s election victory in the state was fraudulent turned down doing that We have a law in the state of Georgia that clearly outlines the legal steps that can be taken if constituents believe their local prosecutors are violating their oath by engaging in unethical or illegal behavior Kemp said at a press conference today according to WSB TV He characterized a special session targeting Willis as unfeasible and potentially also unconstitutional and said As long as I am governor we re going to follow the law and the constitution regardless of who it helps or harms politically Politico obtained the document in which Donald Trump entered his not guilty plea and waived attending next Wednesday s arraignment in the Georgia election subversion case A couple of Donald Trump s other co defendants in the Georgia election subversion case have opted out of next week s arraignment and entered not guilty pleas in writing Sidney Powell a lawyer who briefly worked for his campaign during the period when he tried to overturn the election entered her plea on Tuesday Ray Smith another former Trump lawyer pleaded not guilty on Monday All defendants who have not yet entered pleas will appear at an in person arraignment in Atlanta set for Wednesday of next week Donald Trump has entered a plea of not guilty to the charges brought against him by Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis for trying to overturn Georgia s presidential election results in 2020 By entering his plea Trump opted to skip an in person arraignment of the 19 suspects charged by Willis which is scheduled to take place in Atlanta next week Here s Clarence Thomas s nine page financial disclosure form obtained by the Washington Examiner The document covers last year and on page two you can see Thomas reporting the trips he took on Republican megadonor Harlan Crow s dime One was a return flight from Dallas Texas which he said was necessary due to unexpected ice storm Crow pops up twice more as paying for transportation and meals when Thomas was the keynote speaker at the American Enterprise Institute s Conference at Old Parkland and then as paying for Transportation meals and lodging when Thomas was his guest in Keese Mill New York On page eight is Thomas s acknowledgement of his real estate deal with Crow Although outside the covered period filer provides the following supplemental information regarding the 2014 disposition of certain real estate interests he held with members of his family in Savannah Georgia In 1984 filer inherited a 1 3 interest in three properties his mother s residence and two additional houses on the same street In 2014 Mr Harlan Crow a longtime friend of filer and his wife bought all three properties for 133 000 along with other houses lots on the same street Filer and his wife had put between 50 000 to 75 000 into his mother s home in capital improvements over the years and therefore the transaction amounted to a capital loss Filer had previously reported his interest in two of the Savannah properties excluding his mother s residence in the years when they generated rental income Once these properties no longer generated any rental income filer was advised by Committee staff to remove the two properties from his disclosure forms However filer inadvertently failed to realize that the sales transaction for the final disposition of the three properties triggered a new reportable transaction in 2014 even though this sale resulted in a capital loss Conservative supreme court justice Clarence Thomas has acknowledged trips paid for by Republican megadonor Harlan Crow in a disclosure released today after a delay CNN reports Reports from ProPublica and other media outlets including the Guardian released earlier this year found Thomas the court s longest serving conservative justice had questionable entanglements with parties interested in its cases including by taking luxury vacations with Crow In the disclosure Thomas reports Crow paid for him to fly by private jet for a speech in Texas and a vacation in New York last year and said one of the trips was necessary because of increased security risk caused by the leak of the court s decision overturning Roe v Wade Thomas also said he inadvertently omitted information from previous disclosures and amended them in today s filing to acknowledge a 2014 real estate deal with Crow The yearly report was due in May but Thomas requested and received an extension to submit his filing later Here s more from the Guardian s Martin Pengelly on Mitch McConnell s health scare yesterday the second to occur in public in as many months The Republican leader in the US Senate Mitch McConnell experienced another public health scare on Wednesday when he appeared to freeze for more than 30 seconds while speaking to reporters in his home state Kentucky McConnell 81 was eventually escorted away by staff footage from an NBC News affiliate showed Asked for his thoughts about running for re election in 2026 McConnell laughed and said Oh that s a He then appeared to freeze Coming to his side an aide said Did you hear the question senator Running for re election in 2026 McConnell did not answer The aide said All right I m sorry you all we re gonna need a minute Another aide exchanged quiet words with the senator who said OK The first aide asked for another question saying Please speak up The aide repeated questions loudly into McConnell s ear He gave quiet halting answers Told It s a question about Trump McConnell said he would not comment on the presidential race on the Democratic side or the Republican side The two aides then escorted McConnell away Hours after top Senate Republican Mitch McConnell froze up while speaking to reporters he met with a Republican running for Senate in Indiana yesterday Banks who currently represents a district in the state in the House of Representatives is seen as the frontrunner for the Republican Senate nomination in a state that has lately voted overwhelmingly for the GOP Joseph Biggs a self described organizer for the Proud Boys militia group who was convicted of seditious conspiracy for his actions on January 6 will be sentenced in federal court today Prosecutors are asking the judge to impose a 33 year jail sentence which would be the longest doled out to any defendants facing charges over the violent attack on the Capitol Biggs s sentencing will be the first in a series to take place over the coming days of five Proud Boys defendants including Enrique Tarrio the group s former leader He will be sentenced on Tuesday Last year New York attorney general Letitia James accused Donald Trump of carrying out a staggering level of fraud by inflating his net worth to get better loan conditions Take for example Mar a Lago his south Florida resort The property is worth about 75m but valued as high as 739m the suit said Or 40 Wall Street a commercial property in New York City James alleged Trump had claimed it was worth as much as 530m even though commercial appraisals found it would at best go for 220m James also accused him of inflating the square footage on his Trump Tower in Manhattan calling it intentional and deliberate fraud and not a mistake If a judge finds in her favor it could force Trump to pay a potentially large judgment and bar him and three of his children from serving as executives in New York state or from taking out loans or purchasing properties for five years But perhaps more worrying for the former president was James s announcement that she had forwarded her findings to federal prosecutors though they have not yet said if they will pursue criminal charges based on their work Here s our full report from last year when the suit was filed Good morning US politics blog readers Besides the four criminal indictments filed against him and others since the start of the year Donald Trump is also being sued by New York attorney general Letitia James who alleges he inflated his net worth to secure more favorable terms on loans Yesterday a transcript of a deposition from the former president was made public and reveals just how much James believe he overstated his assets by as much as 2 2b in some years The document also shows Trump making grandiose and rambling assertions that won t be a surprise to anyone who lived through his presidency He for instance asserts that his diplomatic outreach to North Korea averted a nuclear holocaust Unlike the criminal cases against him there s no jail time threatened by this case but in a best case scenario for James a judge could order Trump to pay an expensive judgment The lawsuit is set to go to trial in October but the New York prosecutor is hoping a judge will opt to resolve all or part of the case in a hearing set for 22 September Here s what else we re watching today Questions are swirling about Mitch McConnell s health after the 81 year old top Senate Republican froze up during a press conference yesterday the second time something like this has happened in as many months Hurricane Idalia continues to churn through the southeastern United States and could potentially already be the costliest climate disaster to strike the country this year Rudy Giuliani yesterday was found liable for defaming two Georgia election workers and ordered to pay what could be an

29|Dogman review the most ludicrous film you ll see all year maybe ever Most children indulge in the occasional revenge fantasy Imagine if a famous movie star decided to be your best friend right after your actual best friend stopped talking to you Or how about if MI5 got in touch with you because they needed a kid to help out with a top secret mission Or what if you trained an enormous pack of assorted sizes of dogs to be your best friends and they did your bidding and took down all your enemies and stole diamonds for you This latter scenario is essentially the premise of the new film from Luc Besson and it s as wacky as it sounds Caleb Landry Jones plays Doug our luckless protagonist whose life is such an unimaginably relentless shitshow that he retreats entirely from humanity and holes up in an abandoned school with a pack of dozens of canine chums The doggos rapport with Doug is so strong that it borders on psychic They understand English perfectly They are as happy tiptoeing into a wealthy older woman s bedroom to silently lift an expensive necklace from her nightstand as they are gripping a local crime lord s nutsack in their vice like jaws But Doug isn t just the ringleader of a group of miracle pups A wheelchair user since midway through his wildly violent and dysfunctional childhood he pivots to performing as a drag artist after an unsuccessful job hunting montage set to Eurythmics Sweet Dreams Are Made of This Thereafter he divides his time between crooning dith Piaf and Marlene Dietrich numbers and supervising his gang of canine criminals as they commit various jewel heists He s a multitasker Now if you close your mind to the possibilities of film and write off imaginative gambits as ludicrous without ever having really given a bold vision a chance it s not great cinema should be an art where the ostensibly ludicrous can take flight and flourish All that said and all due respect to the originality and commitment displayed here but this is as ludicrous a film as you ll see all year maybe ever I m sure there s a way to make this theoretically fun premise work better but regrettably Besson hasn t found it Besson reached the height of his popularity in the 1990s with films such as L on and The Fifth Element but has since faced rape allegations by an actor who worked with him on Valerian and the City of a Thousand Planets before being cleared of all charges Dogman is the intended comeback and it ll certainly make you sit up and take notice Unfortunately once it has your attention you simply can t look away and not in a good way Dogman screened at the Venice film festival  Luc Besson s wacky revenge fantasy follows luckless drag artist Doug and his pack of canine chums that do his criminal bidding you can t look away|18.0|12.0
30|Champions League 2023 24 draw group stage analysis and predictions Group A If games against Bayern Munich and a Copenhagen side albeit FC Copenhagen rather than Brondby evoke a warm recollection for Manchester United of the group stage in 1998 99 there was also a less pleasant 90s memory in Galatasaray Welcome to hell Eric Cantona clashing with police and an away goals defeat These days the Turkish champions are probably awkward rather than intimidating and have signed the very familiar faces of Wilfried Zaha Mauro Icardi Angeli o and Hakim Ziyech Copenhagen fall into a similar category having drawn all three home games in the group stage last season while failing to score at all away from home For Bayern last season was dominated by the dismissal of Julian Nagelsmann and the appointment of Thomas Tuchel which led to a Champions League exit to Manchester City and a stutter in the league that saw them clinch the title only on the final day Two league games this campaign have brought two wins and three goals for the club s record signing Harry Kane To progress Bayern Munich Manchester United Group B For Arsenal returning to the Champions League after seven years the draw could have been a lot worse They were the lowest ranked side in pot two but managed to avoid the really big pot one sides drawing Sevilla the Europa League winners Of the players who played in last season s final Yassine Bounou and Gonzalo Montiel have gone and Sevilla lie bottom of La Liga after three games but they showed what awkward opponents they can be against City in the Super Cup Lens the lowest ranked side left in the competition finished just a point behind the French champions Paris Saint Germain last season but the sales of Seko Fofana and Lo s Openda have hit them hard and they have taken just a point from their first three league games this campaign The sale of Xavi Simons to PSG and then on loan to RB Leipzig is a blow for PSV but last season s Dutch runners up thrashed Rangers in the final qualifying round To progress Arsenal PSV Eindhoven Group C It was a first round clash between Napoli and Real Madrid in 1987 88 that led Silvio Berlusconi to propose a group stage for the competition for him losing the champions of either Spain or Italy so early was absurd The result was the Champions League and although Napoli and Madrid can meet again in the first round Madrid do so as runners up in Spain and both will probably go through After winning Serie A for the first time in 33 years last season Napoli have managed to hang on to most of their stars with Kim Min jae the only major departure among players although Luciano Spalletti stood down as coach to be replaced by Rudi Garcia Jude Bellingham was the big summer signing for Madrid with Karim Benzema departing Braga finished third in Portugal last season and have since signed Jos Fonte and Jo o Moutinho while Union Berlin are a rare side in Germany in preferring to sit deep rather than gegenpressing an approach that brought them a surprise fourth place last season To progress Real Madrid Napoli Group D Internazionale beat Benfica in last season s quarter final and also in the final of 1964 65 but both face a challenge to progress in what may be the most intriguing group ngel Di Mar a has arrived amid the usual swirl of transfers at Benfica who finished top of their group last season pushing Paris Saint Germain down into second and eliminating Juventus which went some way to rehabilitating their coach Roger Schmidt after his disappointing spell at Bayer Leverkusen and subsequent stint in China Beaten finalists last season and third in Serie A Simone Inzaghi s Inter have made several notable if not especially youthful signings Alexis S nchez Yann Sommer Juan Cuadrado and Marko Arnautovi arriving Fourth in Spain last season Real Sociedad were a revelation playing vibrant football based around David Silva He has now retired but Kieran Tierney and Andr Silva have arrived on loan Salzburg have won 10 successive Austrian Bundesliga titles but have still made it through the group stage of the Champions League only once To progress Inter Benfica Group E For all their occasional promise Celtic didn t win a game in last season s Champions League their last victory in the group stage coming at Anderlecht in 2017 when Brendan Rodgers was manager After his return in the summer Celtic have a reasonable chance not just of improving that statistic but of progression Feyenoord who beat them in the 1970 final have after a first Eredivisie title in six years retained Arne Slot as coach and most of their squad although the loss of Orkun Kokcu to Benfica weakens central midfield but they were the lowest ranked pot one side Lazio claimed second place in Serie A last season but Sergej Milinkovic Savic has been sold since then and Maurizio Sarri s side s start to this season has been dismal with defeats to Lecce and Genoa At some point Atl tico will stop being in transition and people will stop talking about Diego Simeone looking to adopt a more expansive approach but not yet and they remain a team apparently perpetually battling perceived decline To progress Atl tico Madrid Feyenoord Group F If Newcastle wanted their return to the Champions League group stage after 21 years to be about uncomplicated qualification for the knockouts they were probably disappointed But if they wanted glamour they could hardly have got a better draw Neymar has gone from PSG and although Kylian Mbapp remains for one season at least this is the beginning of their post gal ctico era How realistic that is and how thoroughly Luis Enrique is able to sluice away the culture of indulgence that has undermined the club for years will be one of the fascinations of the early part of this season This could be a difficult campaign for Borussia Dortmund after the emotional turmoil of losing the Bundesliga on the final day of last season and the sales of Jude Bellingham and Rapha l Guerreiro Milan meanwhile have begun the season with two wins out of two three goals for Olivier Giroud and two for Christian Pulisic Ruben Loftus Cheek has also settled well To progress PSG Newcastle Group G Poor RB Leipzig They have beaten Manchester City and drawn with them in their two meetings in Germany but two games at the Etihad have brought a 7 0 and a 6 3 defeat Christopher Nkunku Dominik Szoboszlai and Josko Gvardiol have all gone and a defeat by Bayer Leverkusen has perhaps tempered expectations but beating Bayern 3 0 in the Super Cup showed just how dangerous Leipzig can be It s four years since Red Star Belgrade last won a game in the Champions League group stage and 31 years since they last made it to the last 16 or beyond They have scored 18 goals in five league games so far this season but that may not help them at this level Young Boys romped to the Swiss title last season and remain unbeaten this campaign although they have drawn three out of four away from home Victory over Maccabi Haifa in the fourth qualifying round was comfortable enough As Pep Guardiola chases a record fifth Champions League progress should be straightforward To progress Manchester City RB Leipzig Group H Barcelona won La Liga last season but doubts remain as to their quality Two comfortable defeats by Bayern and a single point against Inter condemned them to a group stage exit last season and they were well beaten by Manchester United in the Europa League Ilkay G ndogan and Oriol Romeu have arrived in a new look central midfield They will welcome back Dmytro Chyhrinskyi their former centre back who has returned to Shakhtar eight years after he left As the Ukrainian champions continue to struggle with the impact of the war it s largely been a summer of departures they will play home games in Hamburg Porto claimed the scalp of Atl tico in the group stage last season but a 2 0 defeat by Benfica in the Portuguese Super Cup perhaps suggested their level Antwerp sealed their first league title in 66 years last season with a stoppage time goal from Toby Alderweireld That previous Belgian championship got them into the 1957 58 European Cup where they played a single tie losing 8 1 to Real Madrid To progress Barcelona Porto Newcastle can progress from a daunting looking Group F and the other Premier League sides should advance too|11.0|11.0
31|Johannesburg fire survivors describe jumping from windows as death toll rises to 74  Survivors of a fire that ripped through a building in Johannesburg described jumping out of windows to escape the flames as questions were raised about the dilapidated and dangerous state of the informal dwellings housing asylum seekers in the city The death toll rose to 74 on Thursday afternoon after the blaze that took hold shortly after midnight Dozens more people were being treated for injuries in hospitals around the city Twelve of those killed were children the Gauteng health department said Rescuers combed the multi storey building in the centre of Johannesburg floor by floor for much of the day The walls were blackened with soot and all the windows were broken some by the inferno itself and others by desperate people trying to jump to safety When the fire broke out at about 1am on Thursday the only door in and out of the building was locked leaving residents with no way to escape This was a routine precaution to prevent theft and to slow down any potential police raids An estimated 400 vulnerable people lived in the building at 80 Albert Street on an informal basis they included extremely poor migrants and asylum seekers predominantly from Malawi Tanzania and Zimbabwe and a number of South Africans On Thursday hundreds of people gathered behind police lines hoping for information on friends and family members who lived in the building We have not been told anything said Mpathu Motani who was waiting for news of her sister We are feeling very bad Omar Arafat from Malawi who lived in the building said he was woken up at about 1am by loud bangs and screams of fire fire He rushed for the building s front door but his path was blocked by flames With no other avenue of escape he broke a window in his third storey room and jumped He said he did not remember anything else I was out for three hours he said When he regained consciousness he was surrounded by fire engines and ambulances There were dozens of bodies on the road around him When I got up I thought where is my sister Joyce Adam Arafat s sister lived in the building and had yet to be accounted for Her two year old daughter who was thrown out of a window and caught by people at ground level was being cared for by other relatives Musa a shopkeeper from Tanzania also said he jumped from this room on the third floor Somehow he escaped injury His brother Said was less fortunate he broke his back on impact and died shortly afterwards In addition to the dozens of emergency service and police vehicles local government officials and politicians gathered outside the building This is a tragedy of immeasurable proportions said Mmusi Maimane leader of the Build One South Africa party He said living conditions in the building should never have been allowed to get so bad It s symptomatic of law enforcement in the city that has all but collapsed Dumisani Baleni a provincial spokesperson for the Economic Freedom Fighters party also speaking at the scene said This building was flagged as not safe for inhabitants His party is currently part of the city s fragile governing coalition The building is in the heart of Johannesburg s dilapidated central business district and is one of hundreds hijacked unlawfully occupied and receiving little in the way of public services It is owned by the City of Johannesburg but the municipality took no active role in managing or maintaining the building Instead according to residents who spoke to the Guardian rent was paid to a syndicate who controlled the building Rooms cost about R1 000 42 a month Residents said little to no maintenance was carried out on the premises and there were no fire extinguishers or emergency exits An unreliable electricity supply meant that paraffin lamps and candles were used for lighting and portable gas stoves for cooking The water supply was sporadic At the front entrance is a blue plaque signifying the historical significance of the building 80 Albert Street was the office of the Non European Affairs Department established by the apartheid government in 1954 to administer its hated pass laws which restricted the movement of black people The dompas which controlled the movement of African people was issued here the plaque reads Baleni estimated that there were more than 1 000 buildings in central Johannesburg in a similar state of neglect a precipitous decline for what was once the country s richest suburb He said that the city had repeatedly tried to resolve the question of illegally occupied buildings with a strategy aiming to clear them out one by one but that it had been hampered by legal challenges When you try to do this you get interdicted by certain organisations that seek to interfere he said referring to NGOs such as the Socio Economic Rights Institute of South Africa and the Inner City Federation which argue that residents cannot be evicted unless they are provided with adequate alternative accommodation We are saying to the city we don t mind to clean up those buildings But they must provide alternative accommodation for those people who are residing there This building was flagged as not safe for inhabitants said the treasurer of the Inner City Federation If they said those people must go out out where On the street The city might have taken more action if the building s residents had not been predominantly foreigners the treasurer added The constitution also protects foreigners it doesn t matter where they are coming from Gauteng Human Settlements councillor Lebogang Maile said that people displaced by the fire would be provided with alternative housing We ve agreed that we are not going to deal with people on the basis of their nationality At this point we are going to give humanitarian assistance to everyone Maile said  Blaze at five storey block puts spotlight on dangerous state of hijacked city buildings occupied by vulnerable

32|How birthright rule is giving teams the X factor for Rugby World Cup For Charles Piutau Tonga s 102 0 defeat by New Zealand in July 2021 was a line in the sand It was a thrashing that came with caveats Covid 19 travel restrictions meant a weakened Tonga team but as the All Blacks ran in 16 tries without reply in Auckland it was clear things had to change Less than six months later change finally came World Rugby approved landmark amendments to its eligibility criteria allowing players to switch Test nations in time for the World Cup In what has become known as the heritage or birthright rule players were now eligible to switch nations if they have been stood down for three years and if they or a parent or grandparent were born in the country they wish to represent The change had been a key part of the manifesto on which Bill Beaumont ran for re election as World Rugby s chairman but required sustained lobbying from the former England captain to win enough support when it came down to a vote It was not unanimous and Joe Schmidt who had just stood down as World Rugby s director of rugby and high performance also played a significant role in convincing wavering voters The upshot was that players such as Piutau who won 17 caps for New Zealand between 2013 and 2017 could resurrect their international careers Previously the only route available was a convoluted sevens loophole but suddenly the door was flung open It was massive the gap between the tier one nations and tier two had got too big This is just the start Piutau says I look at that Tonga game against the All Blacks and a start would be making those games a lot more competitive Social media were suddenly awash with dream teams Tonga Samoa and Fiji could pick and the change has been met with approval in the upper echelons of the game It s a very sensible rule says Eddie Jones the Australia coach It gives players who have represented other countries and have natural allegiances to play for another country it s very good Steve Hansen who coached New Zealand to their 2015 World Cup triumph agreed These nations are getting stronger and with the new rule they ll be really strong Along with Piutau Tonga head to France with Adam Coleman Vaea Fifita and Tau Koloamatangi bolstering their forward ranks Augustine Pulu is also part of their squad as is Toulouse s classy centre Pita Ahki having previously been unable to represent Tonga because he played sevens for New Zealand So too George Moala albeit suspended for their first three matches and Malakai Fekitoa who had already taken advantage of the sevens loophole Israel Folau would probably have joined them if not for an untimely knee injury This is obviously a different class of side compared to teams we have had in the past and it provides us with some massive X factor Tonga s head coach Toutai Kefu says Samoa have called on Lima Sopoaga Ben Lam Christian Leali ifano Charlie Faumuina Steven Luatua and Fritz Lee The effect is already obvious judging by how closely Samoa ran Ireland last Saturday Samoa lest we forget are in the same World Cup pool as England which brings us on to Fiji who last Saturday put Steve Borthwick s side to the sword Fiji are a different case altogether however because they have not taken advantage of the birthright law in their World Cup squad The former All Black Seta Tamanivalu made the switch but has been rehabilitating from injury and did not make the final squad Instead the head coach Simon Raiwalui has put his faith in 18 players from the Fijian Drua side who have been holding their own in Super Rugby since being admitted in 2022 When World Rugby made the change Raiwalui Fiji s high performance manager at the time was sceptical He questioned the detrimental impact on youngsters who have come through the pathway system only to lose their place to returning stars It is a similar view offered by Billy Vunipola when he has been asked if he would one day like to represent Tonga There is a tendency to lump the three Pacific island nations together but there are far more people in New Zealand who identify as having Samoan or Tongan heritage than Fijian So it stands to reason the change would benefit Samoa and Tonga disproportionately while Fiji have selected a significantly higher percentage of homegrown players It should also be said that not all tier two nations support the change or reap the benefits Uruguay have described the move as a backwards step and have claimed that countries such as theirs are in effect being penalised for focusing their efforts on producing homegrown players They question why Tonga and Samoa have been granted permission to pick All Blacks while Georgia who continue to make strides based on domestic development can not enter the Six Nations In other words those who have not properly invested in domestic development are being rewarded whereas those that have are not Moreover rarely do law changes come without unintended consequences in this case that tier one nations would take advantage Samoa Tonga Romania and Namibia have all picked birthright players in their World Cup squads but so too have Wales Henry Thomas Scotland Jack Dempsey and South Africa Jean Kleyn You can hardly fault Warren Gatland Gregor Townsend or Jacques Nienaber for taking advantage of the laws as they are now written nor those players for accepting a route back into Test rugby But it does not sit well that Wales Scotland and South Africa are picking up cast offs from England Australia and Ireland respectively The law change was not intended to give them quick fixes in problem positions rather than encourage them to develop depth themselves The example of Kleyn sticks in the craw for two reasons First South Africa voted against the law change Second he is a classic example of a project player someone recruited by Ireland when on the fringes of the Springboks setup with the explicit intention that they would qualify on residency grounds soon enough Kleyn won five caps for Ireland in the buildup to and at the 2019 World Cup and there is every chance he faces his former country in France given they and South Africa are in the same pool Increasingly the law change comes to be seen as flawed It bolsters Tonga and Samoa and therefore makes for a more competitive World Cup but it does little for wider or more long term development and it is being exploited by bigger countries If the mouth waters at the prospect of Piutau leading the charge for Tonga then equally there is a sour taste to that of Kleyn in action for the Springboks Or that teams such as Uruguay feel so disadvantaged by World Rugby s change Upsets by Samoa or Tonga could set the World Cup alight but the eligibility changes must not be seen as a short cut for sustained change  Tonga and Samoa head to France with squads enhanced by players capped elsewhere but eligibility changes may have drawbacks|14.0|14.0
33|Former member of Belarus hit squad to stand trial over disappearances A former member of the Belarusian special security forces unit overseen by Alexander Lukashenko the authoritarian president is to stand trial in Switzerland next month over the forced disappearance of political opponents in the 1990s Human rights groups said the historic trial was a decisive step forward in the fight against exemption from punishment for crimes committed in the country which could pave the way for future prosecutions of Belarusian officials Yuri Harauski a former member of a military unit known as SOBR and often referred to as Lukashenko s hit squad will face trial on the basis of universal jurisdiction on 19 and 20 September in the northern Swiss regional court of St Gallen for his involvement in the disappearances of three leading figures of the opposition in 1999 The victims who disappeared between May and September 1999 were Yury Zakharenka the former minister of the interior Viktar Hanchar a former deputy prime minister during the early years of Lukashenko s presidency and Anatoly Krasouski a businessman and close friend of Hanchar Attempts by their families to obtain information from Belarusian authorities about their whereabouts have been blocked for years by police and security officials Their relatives case was taken up by the Geneva based non governmental organisation Trial International Viasna the Minsk based human rights organisation and the International Federation for Human Rights FIDH Ilya Nuzov head of FIDH in eastern Europe said Harauski s trial could have far reaching consequences This could be a watershed moment for international justice for the Belarusian regime s crimes he said Harauski s trial might not only secure a conviction for one of the perpetrators of these heinous crimes it could also establish facts which could later be used to go after those who had ordered the commission of the crime including Lukashenko himself Lukashenko s regime has come under increasing criticism for its crushing of opposition movements that intensified three years ago after a disputed election in 2020 Opposition figures have been persecuted at home and abroad and those imprisoned in Belarus claim to have been tortured Harauski an ex convict lives in St Gallen having applied for asylum in Switzerland in 2018 according to Belarusian monitors He was highly vocal about his involvement in the kidnapping and murder of Lukashenko s opponents in 1999 even making public confessions about them in media interviews He has signalled his willingness to be tried for his involvement but has expressed his wish to be tried in Switzerland and not in Belarus In an interview with the German broadcaster Deutsche Welle in 2019 Harauski said that those who disappeared had been punished for seeking the resignation of Lukashenko and were abducted by members of SOBR including himself under the leadership of Dmitri Pavlichenko the military unit s head who Harauski said had shot the victims Harauski has said he knows where the three men were buried Pavel Sapelko lawyer for the Minsk based Viasna welcomed the announcement that the trial would take place With this first ever prosecution of an alleged member of Lukashenko s hit squad we are sending a strong signal he said in a statement Justice for international crimes can and will be delivered regardless of state borders or time elapsed since the crimes have been committed Step by step we are making impunity impossible for international criminals Philip Grant executive director for Trial International said the case would send a huge signal It was the first time that a member of Lukashenko s special forces would be brought to justice he said and the first time that a case of enforced disappearance had been brought before a court on the basis of universal jurisdiction so it s going to set some very simple precedents Earlier this week Swiss authorities announced that a former Algerian minister of defence Khaled Nezzar is to stand trial in the country on charges of war crimes and crimes against humanity between 1992 and 1994 the early years of the Algerian civil war Last week Switzerland issued an international arrest warrant for the extradition of Rifaat al Assad who is known as the butcher of Hama and is the uncle of the current Syrian president in connection with war crimes committed in 1982 Switzerland s readiness to pursue such significant cases on the basis of universal jurisdiction is credited to its current attorney general Stefan Bl ttler who took office in 2021 pledging to apply the law to both national and international cases as long as evidence was solid He was recently re elected by parliament for a second term Lukashenko has strongly denied any involvement in the disappearance of the three men in 1999  Yuri Harauski will be tried in a Swiss court over the disappearance of two political opponents of Alexander Lukashenko and a businessman|1.0|1.0

37|Donald Trump pleads not guilty in Georgia election racketeering case Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges that he conspired and engaged in racketeering activity to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in the state of Georgia according to a court filing submitted by his lawyer in superior court in Atlanta The former president also attested in the filing that he would waive his arraignment the formal reading of the indictment handed up by a jury this month meaning he will not need to appear for that proceeding next week As evidenced by my signature below said the two page filing submitted in Fulton county superior court by Trump s lead lawyer Steven Sadow I do hereby waive formal arraignment and enter my plea of NOT GUILTY to the Indictment in this case Trump s Sharpie written signature marks the fourth time in as many months that he has pleaded not guilty to criminal charges after previously being indicted in a hush money case in New York in a classified documents case in Florida and in a federal 2020 election subversion case in Washington But it was no less momentous given the seriousness of the allegations in the sprawling 41 count Fulton county indictment which alleges Trump and 18 co defendants violated Georgia s state Rico statute in pursuing a multi pronged effort to undermine the results of a fair election The conclusion of the plea and arraignment process starts the pre trial phase of the case No trial date has yet been set for Trump though the Fulton county district attorney Fani Willis asked to try all 19 defendants together starting on 23 October after two ex Trump lawyers sought a speedy trial On Thursday lawyers for Donald Trump moved to sever his case from two defendants who have asked for their own trials to be speeded up We re in a huge state of flux right now attorney Bob Rubin told Georgia s WABE The case involving these 19 defendants seems to be going in a lot of different directions all at the same time Trump s lawyers have also been weighing whether to seek to have the case moved to federal court according to two people familiar with the matter and are expected to make a decision based on whether Trump s former chief of staff Mark Meadows is successful in his effort To have the case moved to the US district court for the northern district of Georgia Trump would have to show that the criminal conduct alleged in the indictment involved his official duties as president he was acting under color of office and cannot be prosecuted at the state level The reasons to seek removal to federal court are seen as twofold the jury pool would expand beyond just the Atlanta area which skews heavily Democratic and a federal judge might be less deferential to local prosecutors compared with judges in the Fulton county superior court Regardless of the final trial venue and jurisdiction Trump s overarching legal strategy has been to delay Even with the Georgia case if Trump were to win re election he could theoretically have the case frozen while he assumes the presidency legal experts have said Last week Trump surrendered at the Fulton county jail where he was processed as any other criminal defendant He had his fingerprints taken his height and weight recorded and submitted himself to a mugshot that the Guardian previously reported he had desperately sought to avoid The booking came during the primetime viewing hours for the cable news networks a time slot that Trump is said to have insisted his lawyers negotiate with prosecutors in an apparent effort to distract from the indignity of the surrender The strategy to turn the surrender into a made for television circus has also been an effort to discredit the indictments a person familiar with the matter said as well as to capitalize on the information void left by prosecutors after the events to foist his own spin on the charges And in a sign of the deeply interwoven nature of the Trump 2024 campaign and the legal team his top political advisers at the very least explored whether Trump should appear for the arraignment and hold a press conference afterwards for optics reasons the person said The bond for Trump was agreed at 200 000 the highest amount of any of his co defendants including his former lawyer Rudy Giuliani who turned himself in for booking a day earlier after his bond was set at 150 000 after being charged with principally the same counts  Former president s court filing means he will not appear in Fulton county for formal arraignment next week|1.0|2.0

fertiliser exports by limiting Russia s access to global payment systems and insurance Lavrov repeated Russia s position that it will return to the deal once its demands are met Everything rests on the fact that the West is hindering the solution of problems that prevent a more active export of Russian grain and fertiliser Turkey wants the warring sides to return to the agreement and use it as a basis for broader peace talks Fidan said Turkey wanted to begin a process focused on understanding and answering Russia s demands As the Turkish diplomat visited Moscow the UN chief Antonio Guterres

and the Baltic states for Wagner fighters sheltering in his country to leave AFP reports Wagner fighters took refuge in Belarus after they staged a short lived rebellion against Moscow s military leadership in June prompting concerns from neighbouring countries They are whipping up hysteria about the presence of Wagner private military employees on our territory Lukashenko told members of his security council They have reached the point where they are already demanding their immediate withdrawal from Belarus he said calling these demands unreasonable and stupid Poland and the Baltic nations on Monday asked Belarus to expel members of the mercenary group issuing the call days after Wagner leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in a mysterious plane crash in Russia Poland which shares roughly 250 miles of border with Belarus says thousands of Wagner fighters are stationed in the country posing a security threat Lithuania said earlier this month it was temporarily suspending two of its six border crossings with Belarus citing the security risk posed by Wagner Igor Girkin a prominent Russian ultranationalist in custody awaiting trial on charges of inciting extremism said on Thursday he would make a better president than Vladimir Putin describing him as gullible and too kind Girkin s comments were notable for their direct public criticism of the president who he called an extremely gullible person In comments reported by Reuters he added The current president is too kind He also claimed Putin had been led by the nose by Ukraine and the West as well as by Russia s security agencies and defence industry It turned out that neither the country nor the army nor Russian industry were ready for war he said saying officials continue to amaze us with their incompetence Since the apparent death of mercenary chief Yevgeny Prigozhin in a plane crash last week Girkin is the most prominent remaining critic of the way Moscow has waged its war in Ukraine He is a former security officer who helped to start the initial war in Ukraine in 2014 and is best known in the West for his role in shooting down a Malaysian passenger plane over eastern Ukraine in 2014 with the loss of 298 lives for which he was convicted in absentia by a Dutch court He denied involvement How would the arrival of Ukraine impact the EU budget Lisa O Carroll the Guardian s Brussels correspondent has been looking at whether the European Union is ready for Kyiv to join the bloc and the impact it might have on Poland Greece or Hungary who could go from net beneficiaries of EU funding to net contributors Before the invasion says Steven Blockmans the director of research at the Centre for European Policy Studies CEPS some observers took the view that enlargement was clinically dead kept artificially alive by summits within the EU The war changed all of that As one diplomat said Enlargement is not only back on the agenda but it is back as one of the top three issues the leaders are dealing with But the issue of expanding the EU budget which is already under pressure could be contentious and would Germany France and Italy be happy to dig deeper into their pockets to support Ukraine Politically it will be hard to swallow says Blockmans But he notes that many of the potential net beneficiaries are in the Balkans and want to see Russia being pushed back even further and this may trump the negative arguments around the cost of enlargement Read the full piece here Ukrainian troops have achieved some new successes in the south and east as they try to advance their counteroffensive against Russian forces the deputy defence minister Hanna Maliar said on Thursday Kyiv s forces have been making slow progress against Russian minefields and trenches which have blocked a Ukrainian push in the south intended to reach the Sea of Azov and split Russian forces the Associated Press reports There have been some successes in particular in the direction of Novodanylivka Novoprokopivka Maliar said on the Telegram messaging app referring to two southeastern villages in the Zaporizhzhia region Novoprokopivka lies further south of the strategic settlement of Robotyne which Ukraine said on Monday it had liberated Maliar also said Kyiv s forces were pressing on with their offensive operations south of the devastated eastern city of Bakhmut which was captured by Russian troops in May Heavy fighting continues in the villages of Klishchiivka Kurdyumivka and Andriivka Maliar said and added that active fighting was also under way on the Lyman front in the east where Russian troops had attempted to advance near the villages of Novoyehorivka and Bilohorivka in the Luhansk region Although Italy s far right government is one of Ukraine s staunchest European supporters Russian propaganda and disinformation permeates Italian media something researchers attribute to politics and historical anti Atlanticism with openly pro Russian guests invited on the country s most popular talkshows A survey released by Ipsos in April revealed that almost 50 of Italians prefer not to take sides in the conflict Lorenzo Tondo reports Matteo Pugliese an Italian security and terrorism researcher at the University of Barcelona has tracked the procession of Russian government officials ideologues and media personalities hosted by Italian TV networks since the Russian invasion They include the Russian foreign minister Sergei Lavrov and his spokesperson Maria Zakharova the ultranationalist Russian ideologue Alexander Dugin Olga Belova a journalist at Russia 24 an outlet that denied the Bucha massacre and Yulia Vityazeva a journalist at NewsFront based in Russia occupied Crimea and operated by the FSB who in a Telegram post wished a bomb would strike the Eurovision song contest in Turin after Ukraine s victory Compared to other western European countries Italy gave disproportionate exposure to Russian propaganda in my opinion simply because TV producers wanted to increase their share of certain shows with heated debates Pugliese said A British volunteer has been killed in action while fighting in Ukraine his brother has said Sam Newey was killed in eastern Ukraine Sam you gave your life for people you never knew and acted with courage morality and honour said his brother Dan Newey in a Facebook post The alleged co founder and

mercenary group Wagner was buried near Moscow on Thursday after dying in an unexplained plane crash that also killed his boss Yevgeny Prigozhin Reuters reports Dmitry Utkin 53 whose call sign Wagner gave the private army its name was buried in Mytishchi on the outskirts of the capital in a ceremony cordoned off by Russian military police according to the popular online news channel Shot Prigozhin had been buried on Tuesday in an equally discreet ceremony in his home town of St Petersburg that contrasted starkly with his loud and often foul mouthed presence on social media Before helping to found Wagner as Prigozhin s right hand man Utkin served as a special forces officer in the GRU military intelligence service where he held the rank of lieutenant colonel He fought for Wagner to support Moscow s military campaigns in Syria and Ukraine and was photographed in 2016 at the Kremlin with Russian president Vladimir Putin Ukraine s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has hit out at critics of Kyiv s tactics in its counteroffensive against Russia s invasion saying they were spitting in the faces of Ukrainian soldiers and should shut up Kuleba told reporters at a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Toledo Spain Criticising the slow pace of the counter offensive equals spitting into the face of the Ukrainian soldier who sacrifices his life every day moving forward and liberating one kilometre of Ukrainian soil after another The New York Times last week quoted western officials as saying that the offensive had made limited progress because Ukraine had too many troops in the wrong places I would recommend all critics to shut up come to Ukraine and try to liberate one square centimetre by themselves Kuleba said standing alongside Spanish foreign minister Jose Manuel Albares Ukraine came under pressure from the US earlier this month to concentrate its counteroffensive on the southern front amid concerns that the effort had been too spread out As well as trying to press at two main points in the south Ukraine had been attacking around Bakhmut in the east baffling Washington Military insiders in Kyiv argue that Ukraine has to fight on a broad front without significant air support and has to respond to fresh Russian attacks Russia s defence ministry said on Thursday that one of its fighter jets was scrambled to intercept a Norwegian military plane approaching its airspace in the latest of a string of similar incidents In a statement it said the Norwegian plane U turned and moved away from Russian airspace after being approached by the Russian MiG 31 fighter over the Barents Sea Reuters reports Royal Navy warships and RAF patrol aircraft have tracked a series of Russian warships as they travelled close to the UK including through the English Channel PA media reports HMS Tyne HMS Portland and P8 Poseidon aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth carried out the monitoring operation of the Russian navy movements in waters close to the UK including in the North Sea and north Atlantic Plymouth based HMS Portland and the Poseidons worked together to monitor Russian vessels including corvettes Boikiy and Grad cruiser Marshal Ustinov the Udaloy class destroyer Severomorsk and others A navy spokesperson said many of the Russian vessels were associated with the Russian Navy Day which was held in St Petersburg on 30 July He said With their collective array of powerful sensors for locating and tracking the British submarine hunting frigate and maritime patrol aircraft are a formidable duo for locating and monitoring operations allowing for constant surveillance from the sea and air Having detected a ship or submarine the aircraft can communicate the position allowing a warship to intercept and track Portsmouth based HMS Tyne shadowed three Russian ships in separate tasks including Merkury a Steregushchiy class corvette and research ship Akademik Nikolaj Strakhov Grant Shapps knows very little about defence and it will take him quite some time to get up to speed a former chief of the general staff of the British army has said see earlier post at 09 39 on Shapps being announced as the UK s new defence secretary Lord Dannatt told Sky News Ben Wallace did a good job but he leaves with work in progress adding And now we have a new defence secretary who knows very little about defence and it s a complex portfolio It will take him quite some time to get up to speed I think there is a risk that certainly the debate on resources for defence stagnates at least until Grant Shapps can get his head around his portfolio He went on I think what the chief of defence staff and the single service chiefs will be hoping from the new secretary of state for defence is that he will listen to the concerns that they have within the wider context of the insecurity of the world And although he may well have been appointed as someone who is going to support the prime minister and help the Conservative party in its general election campaign they will be hoping that he will really understand defence and push the case for defence not just for the Ministry of Defence s own benefit but for the benefit of the whole country Because there is a very strong case that we should be investing more in defence than we currently are Ben Wallace knew that Ben Wallace was arguing for it Is that discussion going to continue Or will Grant Shapps choose to go quietly You can keep up with the latest political coverage from the UK on this live blog Russia said on Thursday it intended to develop ties with North Korea Reuters reports The White House said on Wednesday it was concerned that arms negotiations between Russia and North Korea were actively advancing and said Vladimir Putin and Kim Jong un had written to each other pledging to increase their cooperation Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov did not answer directly when asked by reporters if the letter exchange had taken place Moscow and Pyongyang maintain good mutually respectful relations We intend to develop them further Contacts are being made at various levels he said calling North Korea a very important neighbour Washington has warned

Korea and Russia Here are some of the latest images coming in from the newswires The Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko said demands for the withdrawal of Russia s Wagner mercenary group from Belarus were groundless and stupid the Belarusian state news agency Belta reported on Thursday Wagner whose leader Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in a plane crash last week relocated some of its fighters to Belarus under a deal brokered by Lukashenko after the mercenary army launched a failed mutiny aimed at ousting Prigozhin s rivals from the Russian defence ministry in June The Kremlin said Russia remained a reliable supplier of grain despite obstacles created by the US and the EU and that food shortages in Africa were nothing to do with Russia Reuters reports The Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov had been asked in a briefing for a response to a reported accusation by the head of Ukraine s security council that Moscow was causing hunger in Africa The number of people going hungry in the world has risen by 122 million to 735 million since 2019 because of the Covid 19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine the UN said in July Russia s invasion of Ukraine a major producer of wheat maize

said that a group of Ukrainian special forces tried to carry out a series of terrorist acts on military and energy infrastructure facilities on Wednesday In the course of operational and combat measures in the Navlinsky district two militants were liquidated five were detained three of whom were wounded he said in a post on social media The Navlinsky district is 40 kilometres 25 miles from the Ukrainian border Bogomaz said that the group used US made automatic rifles and Nato standard ammunition and grenades to carry out the attack sharing an image of what appeared to be seized weapons He said in a later post that three drones were shot down over the region Thursday and that there were no casualties Russia s Federal Security Service confirmed it had suppressed Wednesday s border

before Following his appointment as the new defence secretary Shapps tweeted As I get to work at DefenceHQ I am looking forward to working with the brave men and women of our armed forces who defend our nation s security And continuing the UK s support for Ukraine in their fight against Putin s barbaric invasion Wallace who had been touted as a potential successor to Nato secretary general Jens Stoltenberg had taken a leading role in shaping Britain s response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine last year Under him Britain provided 2 3bn of military aid to Kyiv in 2022 and became the first country to start supplying Ukraine with long range cruise missiles in May this year to help end Europe s biggest land war since the second world war He caused controversy in July after suggesting Ukraine ought to show more gratitude for the help it had received from the west in response to Volodymyr Zelenskiy s complaints that his country had not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato Wallace said that whether we like it or not people want to see a bit of gratitude when asked about Zelenskiy s frustration at not being presented with a formal invitation to join Nato In Ukraine there was uncertainty as to whether Wallace s intervention reflected No 10 policy something Rishi Sunak later made clear was not the case One former deputy from Ukraine s parliament the Rada asked the Observer if the lack of gratitude comment was a manifestation of England s baffling class system We don t understand they admitted Ukrainian Twitter meanwhile lit up with joking memes A newly released video of Wagner mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin purports to show him in Africa only days before his death Reuters reports For those who are discussing whether I m alive or not how I m doing right now it s the weekend second half of August 2023 I m in Africa Prigozhin says in the short video published by the Grey Zone Telegram channel which is linked to his Wagner group So for people who like to discuss wiping me out or my private life how much I earn or whatever else everything s OK he adds with a wave of his hand Reuters was not able to verify the location or the date of the video which was filmed in a moving vehicle Prigozhin s camouflage clothing and hat as well as the watch on his right hand matched his appearance in a video released on 21 August which he also claimed was filmed in Africa His weekend reference implied the latest clip must have been made on 19 or 20 August only three or four days before he and other top Wagner figures and bodyguards were killed in a plane crash north of Moscow on 23 August In June Prigozhin staged an aborted mutiny against Russian military commanders in which his Wagner troops briefly took control of the southern city of Rostov and advanced towards Moscow He was buried at the Porokhovskoye cemetery in his home town of St Petersburg on Tuesday Ukraine s defence minister Oleksii Reznikov is likely to soon be dismissed from his role Ukrainska Pravda reported citing government sources His potential replacement is Rustem Umerov the head of the State Property Fund of Ukraine sources told the outlet Ben Wallace has confirmed his resignation as defence secretary after four years in the post In a letter to the prime minister Rishi Sunak Wallace said The Ministry of Defence is back on the path to being once again world class with world class people The United Kingdom is respected around the world for our armed forces and that respect has only grown more since the war in Ukraine I know you agree with me that we must not return to the days where defence was viewed as a discretionary spend by government and savings were achieved by hollowing out Sunak praised Wallace telling him he leaves office with the prime minister s thanks and respect Wallace played a key role in the UK s response to Russia s invasion of Ukraine and was a close ally of Boris Johnson In May Britain became the first western country to provide Ukraine with the long range Storm Shadow cruise missiles that Kyiv wanted to boost its chances in its counteroffensive The UK s prime minister Rishi Sunak will reportedly appoint a new defence secretary later on Thursday replacing Ben Wallace Wallace announced last month he would resign from the senior Cabinet role at the next reshuffle bringing to an end his four years in the job The armed forces minister James Heappey and chief secretary to the Treasury John Glen have both been linked with the role The Daily Telegraph also suggested former defence secretary Liam Fox is a possibility Ukraine s foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba has met with his Spanish counterpart Jos Manuel Albares He said expanding Spanish military aid to Ukraine was among the topics discussed Spanish prime minister Pedro S nchez has said the war in Ukraine and its consequences would be a priority for Spain s EU presidency Countries holding the presidency traditionally try to set the agenda within the bloc though the results ultimately depend on all member states A military spokesperson says Ukrainian armed forces are making progress in the direction of Novoprokopivka the village beyond Robotyne in the direction of Melitopol The capture of Robotyne was announced earlier this week Even though just a few miles from where Ukrainian troops were at the start of the counter offensive it marked a significant achievement in breaking through an initial line of Russian defences prepared over the winter This is very preliminary but suggests they are consolidating those gains and moving further south The ultimate goal is to break through to the Azov sea severing Russian logistics and communications lines with troops in Kherson and Crimea Hello everyone this is

ceasefire in Ukraine Anatol Lieven writes in the Guardian but there is still a general unwillingness to see Russia defeated and humiliated Complete defeat in Ukraine would lead to the fall of the Putin regime and this in turn could lead to a period of chaos Fears of a new Time of Troubles have very deep roots in Russian culture and were strongly revived by the disastrous experience of the 1990s At the heart of this fear on the part of the elites is a fear of each other or even one might say of themselves The chaos of the 1990s included vicious struggles among the so called oligarchs including in some cases murder It would seem that the elites of today believe that without a strong leader like Putin to keep them in order they would be unable to mediate their differences and hold

39|Thousands of pupils may have to start term online as over 100 schools affected by crumble risk concrete Thousands of pupils in England may have to begin the autumn term taking lessons remotely or in temporary buildings after the government ordered more than 100 schools to immediately shut buildings made with aerated concrete that is liable to sudden collapse The order from the Department for Education was sent to 156 schools school nurseries and further education colleges on Thursday plunging the start of the new academic year into chaos for teachers and pupils The Health and Safety Executive has said the widely used material is now life expired and could collapse with little or no notice School leaders responded with anger when the DfE said it would not fund emergency measures needed to keep teaching going placing extra pressure on stretched school budgets The National Education Union NEU representing teachers described the situation as absolutely disgraceful and warned of massive disruption to the education of thousands of children The latest development represents a sharp escalation of a building safety crisis that has been brewing for years after the weaker lighter version of concrete was widely used in schools from the 1950s to the 1990s It has an estimated 30 year lifespan The government stated that regardless of the assessed risk of a school building made using reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete RAAC blocks they should be taken out of use and mitigations should be implemented immediately Several recent sudden collapses of RAAC roof panels that appeared to be in good condition are among cases that have made us less confident that buildings containing RAAC should remain open without extra safety measures in place the government said on Thursday The sudden change of strategy comes 11 months after the Cabinet Office s government property section launched a search for the material in the wider 158bn government estate including health buildings and police stations On Thursday night the Cabinet Office confirmed that 34 other public buildings had also been found to feature RAAC Investigations are continuing but so far these include 24 hospitals sites with RAAC plank construction in whole or a significant part of their estate Seven of these need a full replacement and will be rebuilt before 2030 One court building has been taken out of use and six others are being managed in accordance with the guidance The Department for Work and Pensions found four buildings affected One has been divested and the rest are being managed The government told schools of the closures This may come as a shock and is likely to cause disruption but the safety of pupils students and staff is our priority In up to about two dozen schools the amount of RAAC involved means students and teachers will need to be moved offsite to temporary accommodation Children could be sent to neighbouring schools sports classes could be moved from affected facilities to public leisure centres and remote online schooling could be restarted as a last resort The DfE said it was taking a precautionary and proactive step adding This decision has been made with an abundance of caution Schools will have to pay for emergency accommodation and transport Headteachers said this was an absolutely ridiculous expectation given the huge pressures on school budgets and vowed to fight back Such are the concerns that schools are being told not to drill cut or disturb anything they think might be RAAC and that any spaces containing RAAC should remain out of use until appropriate mitigations are in place Buildings previously ranked low risk should now also be shut Gillian Keegan the education secretary said Nothing is more important than making sure children and staff are safe in schools and colleges which is why we are acting on new evidence about RAAC now ahead of the start of term The mitigations can include shoring up the structure with supports moving students to other parts of the school or in some cases setting up portable buildings in playgrounds It could involve students having to take lessons from home for anything from a few days to up to two weeks Daniel Kebede the general secretary of the NEU said it was a sign of gross government incompetence that a few days before the start of term 104 schools are finding out that some or all of their buildings are unsafe and cannot be used He added There are 156 schools with confirmed RAAC but how many more where it has not yet been identified Unison which represents more than 200 000 non academic school staff said the situation was nothing short of a scandal Its head of education Mike Short said The DfE and government have squandered valuable months hiding this crisis when they should have been fixing dangerous school buildings Of the 156 affected institutions almost all of which are schools 52 already had mitigations In others the RAAC blocks were already not being used or only constituted small sections officials said All 104 affected schools were contacted on Thursday Guidance sent to the schools just days before the new term begins said caseworkers would help them find either emergency accommodation such as a local college or nursery cabins or longer term sites The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that officials were making hurried calls urging school leaders to draw up contingency plans for buildings at risk of collapse because of crumbling concrete Now schools are being told to take buildings out of use straight away in what appears to be a response to advice to proceed with greater caution Schools are being told the government will help them implement contingency plans quickly to keep disruption to face to face education to an absolute minimum Decaying aerated concrete had been found in 65 schools in England after nearly 200 completed surveys with 24 requiring emergency action according to a report by the National Audit Office The number of schools at risk is expected to increase when the results of surveys of 572 schools with suspected RAAC are published by the DfE Four schools were shut in April and June after RAAC was discovered in their buildings On Wednesday a DfE spokesperson said We have been engaging with schools and responsible bodies about the potential risks of RAAC since 2018 and subsequently published guidance on identifying and managing it Regarding the closure of schools the department said it would provide funding for essential immediate works and support the provision of temporary buildings for schools and colleges affected The Association of School and College Leaders said the rush to establish contingency plans in case buildings collapsed was symptomatic of the government s neglect of the school estate The shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said it was shocking evidence of a department in disarray NAHT the union representing school leaders said it had repeatedly raised concerns so while this news is shocking sadly it is not hugely surprising What we are seeing here are the very real consequences of a decade of swingeing cuts to spending on school buildings said Paul Whiteman the union s general secretary There is no escaping the fact that the timing of this couldn t be worse with children due to return from the summer holidays next week This will put school leaders under tremendous pressure as they have to scramble to organise alternative accommodation The Institution of Structural Engineers warned this year that cracking and spalling were risks in roof and floor panels made from RAAC Many roof panels have been installed with insufficient bearing on structural supports resulting in a significant risk to the material s integrity Some panels have become saturated by water ingress making them heavier than they were designed to be  Students and teachers at dozens of schools in England will need to be moved off site with schools told to foot bill

40|Population collapse almost wiped out human ancestors say scientists Early human ancestors came close to eradication in a severe evolutionary bottleneck between 800 000 and 900 000 years ago according to scientists A genomics analysis of more than 3 000 living people suggested that our ancestors total population plummeted to about 1 280 breeding individuals for about 117 000 years Scientists believe that an extreme climate event could have led to the bottleneck that came close to wiping out our ancestral line The numbers that emerge from our study correspond to those of species that are currently at risk of extinction said Prof Giorgio Manzi an anthropologist at Sapienza University of Rome and a senior author of the research However Manzi and his colleagues believe that the existential pressures of the bottleneck could have triggered the emergence of a new species Homo heidelbergensis which some believe is the shared ancestor of modern humans and our cousins the Neanderthals and Denisovans Homo sapiens are thought to have emerged about 300 000 years ago It was lucky that we survived but we know from evolutionary biology that the emergence of a new species can happen in small isolated populations said Manzi Prof Chris Stringer the head of human origins at the Natural History Museum in London who was not involved in the research said It s an extraordinary length of time It s remarkable that we did get through at all For a population of that size you just need one bad climate event an epidemic a volcanic eruption and you re gone The decline appears to coincide with significant changes in global climate that turned glaciations into long term events a decrease in sea surface temperatures and a possible long period of drought in Africa and Eurasia The team behind the work said the time window also coincides with a relatively empty period on the fossil record We know that between about 900 000 and 600 000 years ago the fossil record in Africa is very scarce if not almost absent while both before and after we have a greater number of fossil evidence said Manzi The same can be said for Eurasia for example in Europe we have a species known as Homo antecessor around 800 000 years ago and then nothing for about 200 000 years However Stringer said there was not convincing evidence for a global blank in the fossil record of early humans raising the possibility that whatever caused the bottleneck was a more local phenomenon Maybe this bottleneck population was stuck in some area of Africa surrounded by desert he said The paper published in the journal Science analysed genomic sequences from 3 154 people alive today from 10 African and 40 non African populations By looking at the different versions of genes across a population it is possible to roughly date when specific genes first emerged the more time that has elapsed the more chance for different variants of a gene to crop up By estimating the frequency with which genes have emerged over time scientists can gain insights into how ancestral populations grew and shrank over time The analysis found evidence for the bottleneck in all the African populations but only a weak signal of the event was detected in the 40 non African populations This is probably due to the ancestors of those of non African heritage having in effect undergone a more recent population bottleneck during the out of Africa migration which would be expected to mask the earlier event The timing roughly coincides with when the last shared ancestor with Neanderthals and another ancient human species the Denisovans are believed to have roamed the Earth Scientists now want to look at whether genetic samples from these ancient cousins share evidence of the same bottleneck which could give new insights into when where and why the species diverged  Genomics analysis indicates that at least 800 000 years ago breeding individuals sank to as few as 1 300|1.0|24.0
41| The heat will eat you up homeless in New Orleans on the hottest days in its history On a scorching July day Athena Sims lay down for a nap on the ground near the tent where she lives by an overpass in downtown New Orleans Sims 46 fell asleep in the shade When she woke up hours later she was in the blazing sun with a splitting headache and a social service worker standing over her shaking her telling her she needed to go to the emergency room You re going to possibly die of heatstroke she recalls the man telling her Ultimately Sims decided not to go to hospital But as heat records shatter across the south unhoused residents are suffering acutely Summers in New Orleans are always brutal but as Ben Schott of the National Weather Service stresses This is not a typical New Orleans summer No person alive has ever experienced a summer like this in the city July was the hottest July the city had ever seen and the second warmest month ever Sunday was the hottest day in recorded history for much of south Louisiana New Orleans hit 105F 40 5C smashing the old record by three degrees The New Orleans mayor and the Louisiana governor have declared heat emergencies In a city accustomed to flooding subtropical plants wither in the drought while marsh fires billow smoke over the highway New Orleans s emergency medical services say they are getting quadruple the normal number of heat related calls Meanwhile unhoused residents stuck outside without relief are battling heat illness fatigue muscle cramps chest tightness headaches and vomiting and outreach workers are ringing the alarm Worse by the day Mike Infinity sitting on a bench in Jackson Square pauses from stitching a piece of blue vinyl into a sandal It s the hottest summer ever he says squinting up while a drop of sweat slides across his temple And people are being run out of the shade Every morning Infinity explains the New Orleans police wake up unhoused residents in Jackson Square and move them from the shade along the fence into the sun It s exhausting he says The police are just blindly pushing us around not taking into consideration the heat or that people are setting up in certain places for the shade he says For them to mess with us in the heat every day on the hottest days of the year He shakes his head Infinity 45 and other unhoused residents of New Orleans have developed strategies to survive the heat Infinity has found a vent that blows cool air from a basement he sleeps near it at night Sims knows a good alley faucet for taking ad hoc showers there s also a broken hydrant near the abandoned power plant that sprays cold water all day long Infinity and Sims are half a mile from the nearest cooling center All but one close overnight I m witnessing people getting weaker Infinity says It s wearing everybody down I m looking at people s faces and it just gets worse by the day Sims and her neighbors have found their saving grace is a bar around the corner that doesn t lock its back door while one person stands lookout the other will duck in and as quickly as possible fill a cooler with ice to tow back to their camp But it s a matter of time she knows before the door gets locked She doesn t know what they ll do then They don t want you in any shade Paula Metzger 61 from Dallas worked for over a decade in construction on the Texas Gulf coast She used to surf she once worked on a shrimp boat I ve been in the sun all my life she stresses But nothing compares to this year s heat Metzger and her common law husband of two years Roger have been unsheltered since they were evicted from an extended stay hotel in March Homelessness in the city has surged 15 since last year linked to a lack of affordable housing In April Metzger s troubles worsened One day she looked down to notice her hands turning black Soon she found that anything that s in the sun would erupt into painful blisters Doctors eventually diagnosed her with PCT a rare skin disorder triggered by sunlight I m getting a blister right there she says pointing to her large toe and then her knee Her limbs are patched with gauze Metzger who uses a walker gets some support from her neighbors Infinity brings her ice and helps her move her things when the police come And Metzger does have two umbrellas to shelter her from the sun but she fears the police will try to take them The heat will eat you up with this concrete she says gesturing to the flagstones beneath her and they don t want you in any shade A spokesperson for the New Orleans police said the policy is to temporarily clear Jackson Square for power washing but that unhoused individuals have the option to go into the park and sit on the benches or grass More houseless deaths than usual Tarik Benmarhnia who researches climate health risks says that unhoused individuals exposure to extreme heat is a huge huge problem that is overlooked Most people who die of heat die of cardiac arrest But it has indirect and sneaky effects on many of the body s vital organs Benmarhnia says When we re hot the heart starts working harder and doesn t stop until the body cools down The kidneys struggle and fail from dehydration the gut becomes permeable and risks infection and even sepsis blood clots break free and cause stroke Individuals experiencing homelessness are at especially acute risk because heat stress is cumulative and without shelter there s no way to escape it Heatstroke is a medical emergency Benmarhnia stresses A person experiencing it can die within minutes When you don t have a break when you re consistently exposed to extreme heat that is why it can be deadly Janick Lewis captain of New Orleans emergency medical services said that last summer they responded to three heat related calls from houseless people This year they ve had 67 According to the New Orleans coroner s office since 1 June 31 people have died who were marked as homeless by investigators meaning an unhoused New Orleanian has died on average every three days this summer While a lack of historic data makes it hard to compare this with previous years social workers said it was more than usual The ecological crisis threatens the lives of those without shelter confirmed Jasmine Araujo founder of the direct aid group Southern Solidarity Several unhoused people the organization works with have died outside during the heat emergency she added noting that affordable and supportive housing could have saved those lives A different kind of heat Houseless people themselves are acutely aware that the heat this year is different On 10 August Lettie Vaughn realized she was in trouble As the day stretched on Vaughn 57 began to experience cramps along with a blinding headache She started vomiting Soon she developed a fever extremely high like I ve never experienced Though she d grown weak and confused she forgot her neighbor s name she dipped a towel in her ice chest and wrapped herself in it to cool down The headache and pains subsided the next day But fatigue took its place She still can t stand in the sun without getting dizzy Benmarhnia says these are textbook symptoms of heat illness Like many others Vaughn is also suffering from heat rash She s found some things help the itching and burning foot powder works okay Hand sanitizer helps dry up the sores Vaughn says she tries to advocate for and protect her houseless neighbors in this heat wave But one thing I ve realized she says when they think that you re homeless you don t have a voice The city is making some mitigation efforts staff bring out bottled water and ice in the mornings But unhoused people have some suggestions of their own Ice packs says Infinity Refurbish an old hotel like they did in Dallas suggests Metzger A large air conditioned wedding tent adds her friend Bob or a city bus parked every few blocks Vaughn remembers that at a festival recently they had outdoor cooling fans for tourists maybe those could help Benmarhnia s suggestion is simple Housing with air conditioning he says Housing is the only way to go  As the city s increasing homeless community battles debilitating heat related illnesses and

42|Rahul Gandhi demands Modi investigation into Adani Group Rahul Gandhi has said India s global reputation is on the line and demanded that the prime minister Narendra Modi opens a parliamentary investigation after the Guardian revealed years of alleged financial violations by the politically connected Adani family Speaking at a press conference on Thursday the most prominent figure in India s opposition Congress party held aloft a copy of the Guardian article detailing how Adani family associates had appeared to use opaque offshore funds to secretly invest hundreds of millions of dollars into shares of their own Adani Group companies one of the most powerful conglomerates in India The report was based on documents obtained by the Organised Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and shared with the Guardian and the Financial Times Gandhi demanded that a parliamentary investigation took place into the Adani Group immediately Gandhi said Why is this one gentleman who is close to the prime minister allowed to move hundreds of millions of dollars to pump up his share price and to use the money to capture Indian assets such as airports and ports Modi is known to have a relationship with the founder of the Adani Group Gautam Adani which goes back 20 years Though Adani has denied any favourable treatment since Modi was elected in 2014 the conglomerate has expanded to become one of the largest in India with monopolies over everything from power and ports to coal and airports and has been awarded some of the largest and most lucrative state infrastructure contracts I don t understand why the prime minister is not forcing an investigation said Gandhi Why is he quiet Why doesn t he say that he is going to make sure that this issue is investigated With India holding the G20 presidency and due to host the leaders summit next weekend where Rishi Sunak and Joe Biden will be among the attendees Gandhi said the Adani revelations called into question the transparency and integrity of India s financial and economic systems at a time when the country was declaring itself open for global business In a statement released on Thursday morning the Adani Group said it rejected the reports in their entirety It said We have complete faith in the due process of law and remain confident of the quality of our disclosures and corporate governance standards The Modi government gave no response to the allegations The share price of all Adani enterprises was down on Thursday after the reports falling collectively by 3 3 amounting to losses of 4bn 3 2bn for the conglomerate The relationship between the Modi government and Adani was first thrown into the political spotlight in January after the release of the Hindenburg report by a New York firm which accused the Adani Group of the biggest con in corporate history including share price manipulation In a lengthy rebuttal the Adani Group denied all the Hindenburg allegations as baseless and an attack on India In response to the Guardian s allegations the Adani Group said they were nothing but a rehash of unsubstantiated allegations levelled in the Hindenburg report Our response to the Hindenburg report is available on our website Suffice it to state that there is neither any truth to nor any basis for making any of the said allegations against the Adani Group and its promoters and we expressly reject all of them Gandhi had first begun questioning Modi on his government s links to Adani and staged a parliamentary walkout after Hindenburg But just a few weeks later Gandhi was found guilty in a defamation case and sentenced to two years in prison a case he alleged was politically motivated for raising the Adani issue Gandhi was automatically disqualified as a politician Nevertheless last month his sentence was suspended by the supreme court and he returned as an MP The Guardian also revealed that back in early 2014 financial regulator the Securities and Exchange Board of India Sebi had been given information by another government agency that the Adani Group might be involved in suspicious stock market activity But after Modi was elected a few months later the investigation disappeared and has not been recorded publicly since In the aftermath of the Hindenburg report Sebi was tasked with investigating the Adani Group but has yet to release its findings Saket Gokhale an MP for opposition party Trinamool Congress said on Thursday he had written to the Sebi chair demanding an urgent investigation into the allegations against Adani Congress party leaders have alleged that India s financial regulatory and investigative agencies have become toothless and reduced to political tools under the Modi government This only goes to show that our institutions failed and rules were violated under their nose said Jairam Ramesh general secretary of the Congress party  Indian opposition leader brandishes Guardian article on alleged financial violations by Adani family|16.0|1.0
43|Newcastle in tough group with PSG and Milan on Champions League return Newcastle have been dealt a fiendish set of assignments against Paris Saint Germain Borussia Dortmund and Milan in their first Champions League group stage campaign since the 2002 03 season There were gasps around the Grimaldi Forum in Monte Carlo when Eddie Howe s side who finished fourth in last season s Premier League were the final team to be drawn in Group F The draw sends them to Germany and Italy to face two old powers but the biggest intrigue may lie in their meetings with the French champions PSG who are Qatari owned and have risen to superpower status on the continental scene with the kind of trajectory the Saudi run Newcastle want to emulate In another high octane pairing Harry Kane and Bayern Munich will face Manchester United in Group A bringing the England captain up against an old domestic rival just weeks after his switch to the perennial Bundesliga winners It is the sides first meeting on this stage since the 2013 14 quarter finals when Bayern prevailed 4 2 on aggregate although the match up is best known for United s dramatic victory in the 1999 final The presence of Kane whose move from Tottenham was made with the clear ambition of a tilt at the Champions League adds an extra dimension given he was United s top centre forward target this summer Eventually they turned their attentions elsewhere deterred by the financial package involved United will also face Galatasaray meaning an encounter with their former player Wilfried Zaha and the Danish champions FC Copenhagen In defending their title Manchester City will be far from despondent with a lower profile draw against RB Leipzig Red Star Belgrade and Young Boys in Group G They defeated Leipzig 8 1 on aggregate including a 7 0 second leg win at the Etihad as recently as March in last season s last 16 While a trip to Red Star will provide a challenging atmosphere there seem few serious obstacles between Pep Guardiola and another run at the knockouts Similarly Arsenal will consider their return to the elite level after a six year absence could have brought sterner tests Group B matches them with PSV Eindhoven Lens and the Europa League champions Sevilla none of whom were champions of their domestic leagues last season Celtic were drawn with Feyenoord Atl tico Madrid and Lazio in Group E while an attractive Group C pits the debutants Union Berlin against Real Madrid Napoli and Braga The Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk who will play their home games in Hamburg have Barcelona Porto and Royal Antwerp in Group H Group D brings together Benfica Internazionale Red Bull Salzburg and Real Sociedad The draw foreshadows the end of an era for the Champions League All of its editions since 1992 have contained at least one group stage of teams divided into pools of four but next season s format will change dramatically to a Swiss system in which 36 sides will play eight matches each and be ranked together in one league This season s competition will be the first since 2002 03 that Lionel Messi Cristiano Ronaldo or Neymar will not feature They have been the biggest names in world football during that period but Messi has joined Inter Miami and his two peers have signed for clubs in Saudi Arabia Karim Benzema who sits behind Messi Ronaldo and Robert Lewandowski in the all time list of Champions League top scorers has also joined a Saudi club Al Ittihad There is a certain amount of pressure on the tournament to generate or amplify new stars especially given the troublesome presence of a cash rich and celebrity hungry Saudi Pro League The gala event in Monaco provided temporary distraction for Uefa after a controversy mired week that has seen one of its vice presidents the Spanish football federation chief Luis Rubiales suspended for 90 days by Fifa pending disciplinary proceedings Rubiales fate has dominated the agenda since his unsolicited kiss on the lips of Jenni Hermoso after Spain s win in the Women s World Cup final  Newcastle will face Paris Saint Germain Borussia Dortmund and Milan in a fiendish group on their return to the Champions League|11.0|11.0
44| Make the place a cauldron Luton s Kenilworth Road ready for top flight  There s been a lot of talk and a lot of noise about Kenilworth Road and I hope people see the positive of it tomorrow says Rob Edwards as he prepares for Luton Town s first home game of the season I hope there s real noise that the fans make the place a cauldron because it can make a difference Our supporters have been through some hard times over recent history so coming to the Kenny this weekend will be something really special for them Edwards is the manager who has presided over a small miracle in the past 10 months He has taken Luton to the Premier League for the first time and their home at Kenilworth Road has become a symbol of their unlikely success Photos of the modest stadium the smallest the division has witnessed with a capacity of less than 11 000 have been ubiquitous in coverage of the club The ground evokes history limitation and a certain kind of Englishness It is also a world away from how elite football customarily presents itself The charms of Kenilworth Road are already notorious For away fans to get into the Oak Road Stand they famously have to walk through a row of terraced houses Once inside they will find terracing where the seats are so tightly packed as to make standing up compulsory The Main Stand that s what it s actually called has stood for more than a century and is made of wood To get to the toilets you have to stoop to pass through the exit As for the toilets themselves they are even described as awful by the club s own historian Roger Wash has been working for Luton for 40 years but supported the club his entire life and grew up round the corner from the ground His Hatters Heritage initiative is dedicated to seeking out and preserving connections to the club s past from the minute book that codified its foundation in 1885 to a pair of boots worn by Malcolm Macdonald during Supermac s two year spell in Bedfordshire 88 appearances 49 goals It s a proper old school football ground he says of Kenilworth Road It s not very salubrious but some visiting fans like that They love the experience it s not like going to the Emirates Luton who host West Ham on Friday night have been prevented from playing at the Kenny this season before now due to some essential renovations The ground s Bobbers Stand had to be knocked down and rebuilt a project that was completed in an astonishing 13 weeks The Bobbers used to be where the executive boxes stood a legacy of the last time Luton were in the top flight in the 90s plastic pitch and all the usual football existed before the Premier League disclaimers apply here In the new Bobbers the boxes have been replaced by a media centre with a handful of new seats added and some VAR cameras too The new stand was trialled for the first time in the Carabao Cup win against Gillingham in midweek and Wash has already noted a difference The old Bobbers had no atmosphere but it did have a low slung roof he says Because of the necessity of having a gantry for the TV cameras the roof is now angled more acutely so people are basically going to get wet Wash has also observed that the floodlights are brighter this season There s presumably a Premier League regulation for that he says There is regulation K 172 1 stipulates A club s stadium must have floodlights giving an average of at least 1650 lux and a minimum of at least 1000 lux when measured towards the principal camera on the television gantry The stipulations and demands of modern football are a world away from the era the eras that Kenilworth Road evokes And yet as long as it stands vestiges of the old school will remain Some of those as Edwards notes can have a direct impact on a game of football Not only are the compact dimensions of Kenilworth Road conducive to creating a noisy atmosphere they also shrink the pitch Some people might not like it they might think it s a bit tight They might want a bit more he says But it s gritty It s tight it s compact it s intense It s right there Well it is for now at least Plans for Luton to leave Kenilworth Road are almost as old as the club itself But this summer the chief executive Gary Sweet released images of a proposed new home Power Court Stadium less than a mile down the road but at 19 500 almost double the capacity Even this project it must be noted has been subject to delays and work remains dependent on a final planning application being approved but be it in 2025 or 2026 it appears the Hatters will be quitting the Kenny Edwards is keen to extol the virtues of Kenilworth Road but he is a modern coach an ambitious man and he knows which way the wind is blowing Modern facilities mean fewer hurdles for players they mean more revenue for the club and Edwards believes a move away from where they have played their football for 118 years will not mean Luton losing what is unique to them There is something special and romantic about our place he says But I think you can still have a new stadium and keep what you have whatever it is that unique to you It just probably takes a bit of time Like anything maybe like moving home  The promoted club hope the Kenny with its noisy atmosphere and shrunken pitch can be a weapon starting against West Ham on Friday|11.0|11.0
45|Electricity firms face penalties for manipulating grid in Ofgem crackdown Electricity companies will no longer be able to deploy a controversial tactic that forces up bills at the expense of consumers the energy watchdog has said as it unveiled rules designed to curb firms making excessive profits in the winter Ofgem said electricity generators could face stiff penalties of up to 10 of their revenue for breaching the new regulations which aim to prevent manipulation of the complex system that keeps Britain s electricity grid stable The balancing mechanism is the main tool used by the National Grid electricity system operator ESO to plug gaps between supply and demand on the network It allows the ESO to do deals with generators at short notice to ensure the right amount of electricity supply to maintain relative equilibrium on the grid preventing imbalances that can cause problems such as power outages Under the balancing mechanism electricity generators get paid varying rates for turning their output up or down on a minute by minute basis The cost of this system is ultimately borne by bill payers via network costs included on bills Ofgem said it had acted on concerns that some generators were taking advantage of the balancing mechanism at a cost of hundreds of millions of pounds to households already struggling with sky high energy costs The watchdog said that in previous winters some electricity generators had deliberately stopped generating power early in the afternoon meaning plants were switched off during the crucial evening spike in demand They would then offer to resume generating power later in the day cashing in on the greatly increased prices on offer via the balancing mechanism Annual balancing costs tripled in the winter of 2021 22 as power prices surged to record highs rising to 1 5bn compared with an average of 500m in the previous three years Ofgem said Daily balancing costs hit a record of 60m on a single Wednesday 24 November 2021 while the total annual balancing cost paid for by consumers reached 3 1bn during that financial year Ofgem s measures affect the companies that generate electricity at power plants rather than the suppliers that charge households directly However the costs of the balancing mechanism are ultimately passed on to consumers through their bills According to an investigation by Bloomberg this year the companies that benefited from inflated electricity prices include SSE the German state owned power firm Uniper and VPI which is owned by the commodities trading firm Vitol Ofgem said the new Inflexible Offers Licence Condition IOLC which comes into effect on 26 October would ban this practice and would apply to any generators that switched off their plant for more than an hour Firms can be fined up to 10 of their revenues and forced to make redress to consumers under Ofgem s existing licence conditions Eleanor Warburton the regulator s acting director for energy systems management and security said These new licence conditions show Ofgem will not tolerate electricity generators attempting to take advantage of the balancing mechanism system to make excessive profits through inflexible generation We believe the new licence condition strikes the right balance between protecting consumers and ensuring they pay a fair price for their energy while also enabling a competitive electricity market that provides fair returns for generators We ll be monitoring the effectiveness of it to ensure it s doing what it was designed to do The actions Ofgem s new rules are designed to prevent were not in breach of electricity generators licence conditions at the time they took place The trade body Energy UK which represents energy firms including electricity generators said Balancing costs are ultimately paid by customers so it s right that Ofgem looks at ways to reduce these costs through this measure and other changes to the balancing mechanism The best way to reduce balancing costs over the long term will be through enabling a more competitive and transparent market and an approach to balancing that capitalises on the increasing amounts of low carbon flexible assets across the UK from energy storage to demand side response A spokesperson for the power company VPI said it was a responsible participant in the UK power market and would continue to abide by all relevant regulations VPI was investing 500m to increase power generation capacity it said A spokesperson for SSE said As a responsible operator SSE fully complies with all relevant rules and regulations The Guardian has approached Uniper for comment  Regulator aims to stop power plants tactic that costs households hundreds of millions of pounds|4.0|4.0
46|The Guardian view on Rishi Sunak s new cabinet disloyalty and disunity exposed by shake up Rishi Sunak s mini cabinet reshuffle reveals that the unity his premiership was supposed to beget is a facade The shake up was triggered by the departure of the defence secretary Ben Wallace who was seen as an effective Whitehall operator By contrast Grant Shapps described as a lightweight by the ConservativeHome website is now in charge of the defence of the realm His replacement as energy security and net zero secretary is Claire Coutinho a Sunak loyalist with limited top table experience Both have ended up being moved because Mr Sunak languishing in the national polls as an election looms next year bet this summer that he would gain by siding with motorists and consumers against environmental policies in a cost of living crisis However Mr Sunak badly misjudged voter sentiment on climate issues His rhetoric and policy shifts have not moved the polls but have instead highlighted Tory divisions including within the cabinet Mr Shapps problems began when his energy bill became a battleground between pro green climate sceptic and free market Conservatives This saw the business and trade secretary Kemi Badenoch the current darling of the Tory right able to promote her own anti green agenda making Mr Sunak look weak for failing to push back Ms Coutinho will have her work cut out to prevent major rebellions when the bill returns to the Commons next week If she fails on this key policy question Mr Sunak will find it harder to claim he is chief of the Tory tribe The common assumption is that divided parties do not win elections Mr Sunak has not found the means to deal with it So when his foreign secretary sensibly goes to visit Beijing to seek a pragmatic relationship with China the trip is rebuked by Tory MPs for being the wrong policy at the wrong time The deputy chairman of the Conservative party Lee Anderson says the party has failed on migration In tough economic times the claimed high levels of taxation have become a lightning rod for rightwing criticism of government policy The prime minister is retreating to the values of the most vocal Tory supporters with a mixture of Thatcherite free market policies of tight public spending and pro wealthy tax cuts coupled with populist authoritarianism on cultural issues symbolised by the ridiculous idea of leaving the European convention on human rights But such actions would inevitably divide the party once more on issues that are of limited appeal to the public Conservative failures have transformed the situation for the Labour party which is now the favourite to form the next government The Brexit referendum was supposed to halt the Tories mutation from a centre right party into a populist rightwing mutiny It didn t As a consequence cabinet ministers and former cabinet ministers expend far too much time and energy on the next leadership election rather than the next general election The issues facing Britain are secondary to this process How else to explain the fifth Conservative children s minister in 13 months It would be better for the Conservative party and the country if Mr Sunak stopped trying to appease its factions and concentrated on the job in hand He won t Either way as many of his colleagues who are standing down at the next election like the popular Mr Wallace have concluded it probably won t make much difference to the result   strong Editorial strong Divided parties lose elections but this reshuffle shows that the prime minister lacks the means to unite the Conservative tribe|16.0|16.0
47|The Guardian view on extreme poverty the law should make essentials affordable Proof of the grave financial difficulty into which millions of households have been plunged by the high cost of living continues to mount In a newly released survey almost half of teachers in deprived parts of England reported that their schools regularly provide food to pupils and their families Recent increases in rough sleeping in cities including London and the huge number of people who rely on food banks the Trussell Trust gave out more food parcels in 2022 than ever before are further examples of extreme economic distress Evidence of public concern about such widespread hardship is also accumulating New research from the Joseph Rowntree Foundation JRF and Stop the Squeeze a coalition of pressure groups shows that voters believe both Conservative and Labour politicians are out of touch with the severity of the situation although Labour was regarded by Stop the Squeeze s sample as better placed to tackle it Both the government and Sir Keir Starmer s opposition recognise high living costs as a key electoral issue and a problem that causes most harm to the poorest people In recognition of this benefits were increased this year in line with inflation But momentum is building behind a campaign to persuade them to go further A scheme proposed by the JRF in partnership with the Trussell Trust would enshrine claimants legal entitlement to the essentials of life including food and electricity with the basic level of benefits set by an independent body Currently the JRF estimates that the standard allowance would need to be 120 for a single person an increase of 35 on the present rate of 85 Launched in February the essentials guarantee has won the support of more than 20 health bodies including the British Medical Association and Royal College of Nursing The Liberal Democrats in a pre manifesto issued in advance of their upcoming conference agree that the level of universal credit should be decided independently not by ministers Supporters of the guarantee hope that parliament s work and pensions committee will also throw its weight behind the proposal in a report on benefits due out soon Such a policy could be popular Research shows that most people believe benefit claimants should be able to afford haircuts celebrations and internet connections as well as food and utility bills The public is not by and large out to punish benefit claimants While Labour appears highly unlikely to commit to such a dramatic overhaul in advance of a general election given its extremely fiscally cautious stance these proposals from the charity sector rightly recognise that the drastic predicament that so many now face demands an ambitious response Poverty causes illness along with myriad other social ailments such as addiction homelessness and pupil absenteeism Any government that takes public health and wellbeing seriously must recognise this The austerity policies pursued by the Conservatives since 2010 have massively increased inequality and especially deep poverty among working age people particularly lone parents and large families A rise in the local housing allowance frozen since 2020 and the removal of the two child benefit cap are arguably more urgent priorities than the radical novelty of an essentials guarantee enshrined in law But given Labour s timidity it is a relief to see bold longer term ideas being pushed forward in civil society   strong Editorial strong Benefits are still too low and deep poverty is harmful The idea of a new minimum standard of living is a good one|16.0|16.0
48|Crumble risk concrete is latest upheaval to hit England s schools Pencils are sharpened shirts are ironed but classrooms are at risk of sudden collapse This is the reality of the start of the 2023 24 academic year for more than 100 schools further education colleges and nurseries in England where potentially unsafe reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete RAAC has been discovered After more than a year of extremely disruptive remote learning during the pandemic yet more upheaval looms next week A picture of the potential chaos is clear from Department for Education DfE guidance documents hurriedly published on Thursday just days before the back to school rush The DfE says it is acting in an abundance of caution and to prioritise safety of children pupils and staff and points out that the large majority of schools are unaffected But for those that are headteachers are being advised to look for space in vacant office buildings to approach local community centres to turn them into temporary classrooms and to look into semi rigid temporary structures that can quickly be brought to your school college or maintained nursery school There is not much notice to make such arrangements in effect only one working day for schools due to welcome back pupils on Monday But these spaces need to be secured while safety works lasting weeks are carried out If classrooms have to be filled with temporary props to stop the roof from falling in one option is to try to get children back learning among the supports If it is impossible to teach in such classrooms longer term temporary accommodation should then be erected on site Many schools have cramped campuses already so finding space may be impossible The DfE guidance offers no solution other than telling teachers You will need to discuss this with your caseworker Other pupils could be bussed or sent on public transport to nearby schools providing those buildings aren t at risk of collapse as well Setting aside the disruption to pupils who have been gearing themselves up to start a new year or even a new school in a certain place and alongside certain classmates if this is going to happen by next week school leaders face a tough logistical and safeguarding challenge School leaders have to do whatever they reasonably can to provide the receiving institution with any relevant welfare and child protection information the DfE states For vulnerable children education health and care plans will have to be shared with schools looking after them temporarily Social workers will have to be alerted to the new arrangements This should ideally happen before a child or young person arrives the guidance states For children with special educational needs their information needs to be exchanged too The idea that important matters will not fall between the cracks seems optimistic If this wasn t enough to arrange before next week school leaders have been told they should also be ready to send lunch parcels or vouchers to any children who qualify for free school meals learning at home And then there is the return to lessons over Zoom or Microsoft Teams a practice that resulted in such poor outcomes for children in some cases that many educationalists pledged never again This should only be a last resort and only when other options are exhausted the guidance says But given the lack of notice it seems likely for some at least Recorded teaching will be acceptable There is no mention of what arrangements working parents should make if home schooling is necessary There is no extra money available for any of this The government has been aware of RAAC in public sector buildings since 1994 and in 2018 the DfE warned schools about the need for plans to be in place if RAAC affected buildings needed to be vacated at short notice We expect you to be able to fund anything that is an additional revenue cost for example rental costs for emergency or temporary accommodation or additional transport costs the guidance says School leaders are furious Daniel Kebede the general secretary of the National Education Union said this added insult to injury He said the government is expecting schools to pay the additional costs of its own shocking neglect of school buildings This is not made clear in the government announcement meaning that school leaders are likely to be misled about the full costs to their budget Dame Rachel de Souza the children s commissioner for England is worried After years of disruption for children and young people what they need most is stability and getting back to normal she said We must learn lessons from the pandemic and we need to see proper communication to children and families affected by this guidance There also needs to be clear direction as to where children should go at the start of the new term and reassure them that places are safe and suitable Everything must now be done to ensure the impact on children s learning is minimised And it is particularly important that everyone working with children prioritises those who are vulnerable and those with additional needs  After years of squeezed funding teachers are furious at government s shocking neglect of buildings|16.0|19.0

with all the women who have gone through the same thing Here s the latest on the Spanish football federation scandal with another twist set to unfold The Uefa women s player of the year is Aitana Bonmat That is announced at the same time as the men s player of the year who is Erling Haaland She made sure she got this across It also feels a little different We all know the issues around the Spain team at the moment and it really hurts me as a coach a mother and a daughter I d like to dedicate this award to the Spanish team who played such good football this team deserves to be celebrated and listened to Possibly the toughest group to call is Group D the combination of Benfica Inter Salzburg and Sociedad seems well balanced Celtic also have a shot in Group E alongside Feyenoord Atleti

Multiple sources now report that Manchester United are close to agreeing a deal with Tottenham to loan Sergio Reguilon Reguilon has been granted permission to travel to Manchester to have a medical that puts an end to the move for Chelsea s Marc Cucurella United are still in the hunt for Fiorentina s Sofyan Amrabat Joe Pearson gets in touch Can you explain the subject to international clearance caveat in the Nat Phillips tweet er X Last time I checked the UK includes the metropolitan areas of both Liverpool and Glasgow In accordance with FIFA Regulations international clearance is required for any player over the age of 10 who is seeking to register for a club in England and has previously been registered for a club abroad including the other Home Associations or who is a foreign national seeking to register for the first time in this country Simply put Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland are counted as foreign as they have their own leagues associations Looks like a few out at Chelsea before 11pm tomorrow though maybe not Chalobah Bayern have yet to reach an agreement over Palhinha since Fulham haven t found a replacement Tick tock Meanwhile looks like Cole Palmer will be a Chelsea player very soon There s a Champions League draw on no less Follow it live here Wolves have signed Uruguayan defender Santiago Bueno on a five year contract from Spanish side Girona Some info from Reuters He made his Uruguay debut in March under former Leeds United boss Marcelo Bielsa He s six foot four inches and aggressive as you d expect from a Uruguayan centre back but he can play too and gives us a good balance said Wolves sporting director Matt Hobbs He s a perfect fit for what we ve been looking for Wolves are away to Crystal Palace on Sunday in their next league game Fun fact Nat s dad Jimmy played 25 matches for Rangers in the 1987 88 season before returning home to be Mr Bolton More on Matheus Nunes and his imminent move from Wolves to Manchester City The Wolves manager Gary O Neil has been talking Wolves needed to sell players this summer after going too close to the FFP limits That lost them Julen Lopetegui and brought in O Neil at just a couple of days notice Nunes went on strike earlier this week The situation is resolved he Nunes is signing for Manchester City The offer At that point it was a lot lower and we weren t going to accept If he had rejoined the group I would have told him what I felt When I dealt with him before he worked hard and did what he could for the club Then a big club came calling and players want to play for Manchester City We move on Mark Flatley gets in touch John I m very worried We re drawing nearer to 5pm and STILL no picture from Twitter Instagram of Mo Salah smiling thus confirming that he is staying at Liverpool that s how this works yeah Very worried indeed that this bodes ill Two fine gentlemen of the press David Ornstein and John Cross discussed this last night on Sky A reminder the Saudi window closes far later than the European window meaning a few more days of jeopardy for the likes of Mark Richard Hirst a Fulham fan gets in touch You re right this Fulham fan is very concerned I d be devastated but understand if Palhinha went to Bayern guaranteed championship medal and Champions League football but you d hope that Fulham would at least strike a hard bargain for the best defensive midfielder and a goal scorer to boot in the Premier League Declan Rice money rather than Mason Mount But if you re reading this Joao please don t go It looks as if Fulham are going to lose key man Joao Palhinha That s a real blow Who can they sign before the window closes They re a completely different outfit without him K ri Tulinius gets in touch Roma are my favorite Italian club and landing Lukaku could be a coup But while I m excited about the transfer any hopes I have are tempered by the fact this is Mourinho s third season at the club They could sign Mbapp and Kim Min Jae but it wouldn t break my conviction that this season Jose will muck things up We ve already seen Beto Everton s new striker in action He scored in last night s defeat of Doncaster the lowest team in the EFL in the EFL Cup Sean Dyche ahead of the weekend s match with Sheffield United on the man who must replace Dominic Calvert Lewin It s not about taking pressure off of anyone It s about adding to our strike force We have been searching for that for a long time he is a player we have been monitoring for a long time A player who desperately wanted to come here and so we got that done Back to his performance his clearance came through late so we couldn t plan on him starting but we were hoping he d be available so the plan was always to get him on for a half if we could I am pleased with his performance On that note I shall hand back to John Brewin He shall guide you through this afternoon s transfer thistles and weeds Manchester United are seriously considering signing Sergio Reguilon according to The Athletic It was thought a loan for Marc Cucurella could be struck with Ten Hag searching for a short term Luke Shaw shaped stop gap But the Spurs left back was always a genuine alternative and could now be the favourite Fulham fans may be getting a little concerned Two of their midfielders appear to be subject to serious late window interest with Jo o Palhinha seemingly on Bayern Munich s wish list add him to the merry go round and Wolves coming in for Harrison Reed Man the barricades at the Cottage Marco The England squad has been announced and people are getting predictably angry Ansu Fati chant chat and there have been a couple of shouts for this one It s new and unfamiliar to me I must admit The midfield merry go round looks set to dominate the transfer agenda today and tomorrow The men involved are Ryan Gravenberch Sofyan Amrabat Conor Gallagher and Pierre Emile H jbjerg with Manchester United Liverpool Tottenham and Bayern Munich all looking to strengthen in that area It s the 2011 January deadline day striker scramble all over again Nat Phillips is on the move a six month loan from Liverpool to Celtic looks to be on the cards for the checks notes 26 year old A loan at 26 seems strange doesn t it He ll be solid enough for the Bhoys though Oh Philippe where did it all go wrong Richard in Dublin emails in to express his excitment about the imminent new arrival at the Amex I m already looking forward to the chant You re the one for me Fati Brighton fans please make it happen I reckon we can do even better than that Drop me a line with your chant suggestions Incidentally there are press conferences at Wolves Everton Luton Burnley West Ham and Sheffield United this afternoon No doubt all their respective managers will dish out some tasty transfer scoops Or not There s also the SMALL MATTER of Gareth Southgate announcing his England squad Thanks John I ll begin my power hour with the news that Dane Scarlett is heading out from Tottenham on loan to Ipswich as per several good sources The 19 year old came off the bench in Tuesday night s League Cup penalty shootout defeat to Fulham but is rated by Tractor Boys boss Kieran McKenna as one of the best young strikers in world football Is he making room for a major attacking signing at Spurs Dominic Booth will take the reins for the next hour or so Some West Ham transfer talk from the Telegraph s Sam Dean Old golden Pond no more Or at least not this season Steve Cooper the Nottingham Forest manager had this to say on Brennan Johnson the forward linked with both Spurs and Chelsea He was speaking to BBC Radio Nottingham There is a lot of speculation around at the moment Some of it may be true but some may be as far away as possible I don t look at it Loads of things can happen these next two days Translation there s probably something afoot Gallagher captained Chelsea during their victory over AFC Wimbledon on Wednesday night and Mauricio Pochettino has started him in every game this season However the midfielder has less than two years left on his deal and it is understood there is a strong chance of him leaving his boyhood club before the transfer window shuts on Friday night Chelsea have spent heavily on their midfield this summer buying Mois s Caicedo Lesley Ugochukwu and Rom o Lavia and they are open to offers for Gallagher Wolves have signed an 18 year old winger from Paraguay Enso Gonzalez Nottingham Forest have shed another player in midfielder Lewis O Brien who has joined Middlesbrough for the season Per PA Media The 24 year old was signed by Forest from Huddersfield following their return to the Premier League at the start of last season and made 17 appearances in all competitions before being left out of Steve Cooper s 25 man squad in January This resulted in a temporary switch to DC United managed by former England striker Wayne Rooney where he featured 17 times in the MLS Plenty of transfer talk in this recording from this morning Plenty of other stuff too Anyway here s the latest Football Weekly Extra The Nottingham Forest manager Steve Cooper says deals to sign Nuno Tavares and Murillo are at the final stages Forest have been reported to be close to signing left back Tavares on a season long loan from Arsenal and have agreed a fee of around 15million for the permanent signing of defender Murillo 21 from Brazilian club Corinthians Two signings to conjure top pop tunes Stoke have completed the signing of South Korea Under 20 international Bae Junho The midfielder who joins from Daejon Hana Citizen for an undisclosed fee has penned a four year contract It s another loan for Lukaku whose Chelsea contract still has three years to run though he has agreed to a pay cut to return to Italy Roma are the 11th team he will have played for and he s had two separate spells at Chelsea and Inter Per PA Media Sheffield United have signed Leicester left back Luke Thomas on a season long loan The 22 year old has not featured this season for the Foxes amid uncertainty around his future and has now sealed a return to the Premier League for the 2023 24 campaign He becomes the ninth signing of the summer for the Blades who still want to do more work before Friday s transfer deadline Thomas who won the FA Cup with his hometown club says he turned down interest from other teams to move to Bramall Lane When United came in a few days ago it was an easy decision for me Coming back to playing Premier League football is obviously what I wanted to do he said Coming here is a great experience and I can t wait to get started Per Ben Fisher Wolves have commanded a club record sale surpassing the 47m departure of their former captain R ben Neves to the Saudi Pro League club Al Hilal earlier this summer City and Wolves came to the agreement a deal containing no add ons late on Wednesday night and Nunes has travelled to Manchester to undergo a medical before completing the move Wolves will receive 10 of any profit City make on the future sale of the Portugal midfielder who made clear his desire to move after failing to report for training since Sunday after City s first bid of 47m was rejected Nunes joined Wolves from Sporting in a club record 42m deal last summer and had four years plus a 12 month club option to run on his contract One of the odder deals of the summer though Palmer clearly fancies getting more playing time at Chelsea rather than City Will Unwin with more transfer talk make that Aaron Ramsey Cameron Archer and now Keinan Davis of former Villa youth products shipped out Would Ansu Fati s arrival at Brighton be the coup of the summer And what will it mean for the likes of Solly March Evan Ferguson and Julio Enciso Perhaps the latter s injury forced the issue for

52|What is Trump charged with in Georgia and what is the case about  Donald Trump has been criminally charged by the Fulton county district attorney for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia Prosecutors brought numerous counts against Trump and his associates including forgery and racketeering and soliciting a public official to violate their oath of office among other charges Prosecutors charged 18 other people including Mark Meadows Trump s former White House chief of staff and the lawyers Rudy Giuliani and John Eastman The charges mark the second time Trump has been indicted in connection to his push to overturn the will of American voters after losing to Joe Biden in 2020 Unlike the federal charges filed by Jack Smith the special counsel for the justice department the Fulton county case will proceed in state court That means that Trump would have less capacity to interfere with the case if he is elected president next year and he could not pardon himself Trump is essentially accused of leading an organized crime racket in Georgia via the varied efforts of a web of people collectively to achieve the overturning of his election loss there In the indictment by the state of Georgia the state wrote Trump and the other defendants charged in this indictment refused to accept that Trump lost and they knowingly and willfully joined a conspiracy to unlawfully change the outcome of the election in favor of Trump That conspiracy contained a common plan and purpose to commit two or more acts of racketeering activity The group the state charges constituted a criminal organization whose members and associates engaged in various related criminal activities including but not limited to false statements and writings impersonating a public of cer forgery ling false documents in uencing witnesses computer theft computer trespass computer invasion of privacy conspiracy to defraud the state acts involving theft and perjury Trump waived his right to appear in court for a formal arraignment on the charges pleading not guilty on 31 August What is this case about Donald Trump lost Georgia to Joe Biden in the November 2020 presidential election After the election Trump and his allies made an aggressive but unsuccessful push to invalidate the election results in Georgia as part of an effort to overturn his defeat nationally On 2 January 2021 Trump called Brad Raffensperger the Republican who serves as Georgia s top election official and asked him to overturn the election All I want to do is this I just want to find 11 780 votes which is one more than we have because we won the state Trump said to Raffensperger on the call Raffensperger refused The call came as Trump and his allies including Rudy Giuliani were spreading outlandish lies about the election in Georgia in order to seed doubt about the results Most notably Giuliani and others amplified misleading surveillance video from State Farm Arena they claimed showed election workers taking ballots out from under a table and counting them after observers left for the evening The claim was false counting had not stopped for the evening when the ballots were tallied Just as he did in other swing states Trump convened a slate of fake electors in Georgia The group of 16 people met discreetly in the Georgia capitol in December 2020 and signed a certificate affirming Trump s purported victory that was sent to the National Archives Some involved in the scheme have said they merely believed they were preserving Trump s options amid pending litigation The alternate slate of electors both in Georgia and elsewhere would later become a linchpin of Trump s effort to overturn the election One of those fake electors Cathy Latham also was involved in a separate incident in which Trump allies obtained unauthorized access to Dominion voting equipment On 7 January 2021 Latham helped a firm hired by the Trump campaign get access to voting equipment in Coffee county a rural county 200 miles south east of Atlanta The data was uploaded to a password protected site where other election deniers could download it as they sought to prove the baseless allegation that Dominion voting machines had been rigged and cost Trump the election Why is this case taking place in Fulton county Nearly all of the key events connected to Trump s effort to overturn Georgia s election results took place in Atlanta the state capital which is in Fulton county Raffensperger was in Atlanta when he received the phone call from Trump urging him to overturn the election results Trump and Giuliani targeted election workers in Atlanta and the fake electors convened at the state capitol in the city in December 2020 What is the Georgia Rico Act Georgia s Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Rico Act essentially allows prosecutors to link together different crimes committed by different people and bring criminal charges against a larger criminal enterprise The law requires prosecutors to show the existence of a criminal enterprise that has committed at least two underlying crimes Prosecutors have long used the federal Rico Act to go after the mafia But Georgia s version is even more expansive than the federal statute It allows prosecutors in the state to bring racketeering charges if a defendant attempts or solicits a crime even if they don t bring charges for those crimes themselves How is this case different from other criminal cases pending against Trump This is the second case that has sought any kind of criminal accountability for Trump s attempt to overturn the election It is the fourth time the former president has been charged with a crime this year Earlier in August Smith filed four federal charges against Trump for trying to overturn the election Trump has pleaded not guilty to those charges and Smith has moved to set a trial date for 2 January If Trump were elected president while the case was still pending he would almost certainly move to fire Smith and get rid of the charges He could also theoretically pardon himself if he has been convicted The Georgia case is different because Trump cannot interfere in it even if he is president and cannot issue a pardon In June Smith charged Trump with illegally retaining national defense information under the Espionage Act and obstructing the government s attempt to retrieve the documents Trump pleaded not guilty In March Trump was charged with 34 felony counts of falsifying business records in Manhattan Those charges are connected to a 130 000 payment he made to Stormy Daniels a porn star with whom he is alleged to have had an extramarital affair Michael Cohen Trump s attorney at the time paid the money to Daniels through a shell company and Trump reimbursed him cataloguing it as a legal expense Alvin Bragg the Manhattan district attorney said that amounted to falsifying business records Trump has pleaded not guilty Can Trump still run for president Yes The US constitution does not prohibit anyone charged with a crime nor anyone convicted of one from holding office The 14th amendment however does bar anyone who has taken an oath to protect the United States and engaged in insurrection or rebellion from holding office Relying on that provision a slew of separate civil lawsuits in state courts are expected in the near future to try to bar Trump from holding office Who is Fani Willis the prosecutor bringing the charges in Fulton county Willis a Democrat was elected Fulton county district attorney in 2020 She is the first Black woman to hold the office She worked as the prosecutor in the Fulton county district attorney s office from 2001 to 2018 and is no stranger to high profile cases In 2014 she led the prosecution against a dozen Atlanta educators who conspired to cheat on test scores in order to win funding She is also prosecuting the rapper Young Thug as part of a broader indictment of the YSL gang Willis relied on the Georgia Rico Act in both cases How did the charges come about In January of 2022 Willis requested that a Fulton county judge approve a special purpose grand jury to assist her investigation into Trump A special purpose grand jury can issue subpoenas hear testimony and ultimately issue a report recommending whether or not to charge someone It cannot issue an indictment A regular grand jury was convened in late July and ultimately voted to file criminal charges against Trump Cast of characters In addition to Trump Fani Willis has filed charges of violating the Georgia Rico Act and a variety of other laws against 18 co defendants Mark Meadows former chief of staff heavily involved in efforts to keep Trump in office Rudy Giuliani an attorney to Trump who played a key role in national efforts to overturn the 2020 election results John Eastman an attorney to Trump and key to efforts to overturn the 2020 election result Kenneth Chesebro a legal adviser to the 2020 election campaign involved in the Georgia fake electors scheme

54|Junior and senior doctors in England to strike together for first time in NHS history Junior doctors and consultants in England will strike on the same days together for the first time in the history of the NHS in a dramatic escalation of their bitter pay dispute with the government The British Medical Association blamed ministers refusal to negotiate over doctors salaries for the union s decision to organise stoppages involving both groups of medics The joint action will reduce hospitals and other services in England to providing Christmas Day levels of care for four days in September and October They will stage their protests on 20 September and then on 2 3 and 4 October during the Conservative party s annual conference in Manchester The combined strikes immediately provoked alarm among health service bosses The NHS Confederation chief executive Matthew Taylor said the joint action was the nightmare scenario that NHS leaders have long feared and criticised it as a step that will cause unnecessary delays and distress to patients He added It is inevitable that patient safety is at risk Hospital bosses warned that the coordinated strikes would pose an unprecedented challenge for the NHS It has suffered serious disruption because of strikes by nurses ambulance staff and other staff and then doctors that began last December That action has already forced the NHS to cancel almost 1m appointments and operations It has cost the health service about 1bn in having to pay staff to fill gaps in rotas and lost income for surgeries that hospitals have not been able to do on strike days The BMA announced the joint stoppages when it unveiled the results of a second ballot of junior doctors in which 98 4 of those who took part voted to keep on striking for another six months until early 2024 Consultants intend to continue holding strikes in their own right too The turnout was 71 which meant the doctors union easily met the 50 threshold under trade union law The announcement of coordinated strike action is a serious escalation in the doctors industrial dispute said Sir Julian Hartley the chief executive of NHS Providers which represents health trusts in England Their four days of coordinated action will damage the NHS s efforts to tackle the 7 6m strong backlog of care while junior doctors continuing to strike into early 2024 will make it even harder than usual for the NHS to handle its usual winter crisis Hartley said We now face the grim prospect of another six months of walkouts from junior doctors which will pile even more pressure on the NHS this winter causing yet more disruption for patients But the simultaneous withdrawals of labour by both types of doctors was the most worrying scenario he added The four days will be on top of other days in the next two months on which junior doctors most medics below the level of consultant up to the level of registrar and consultants will stage separate strikes in their own right Consultants will go on strike on 19 September and will be joined by junior doctors the next day the first day of coordinated action But when consultants return to work on 21 September juniors will strike again that day and the day after October will see similar action Consultants will be joined by their junior colleagues for three days of strike action on 2 3 and 4 October Junior doctors went on strike for three full days in March as well as four in April three in June five in July and four in August in pursuit of better pay They are seeking a 35 salary increase in order to achieve full pay restoration after the value of their salaries fell by 26 2 since 2008 But Rishi Sunak and the health secretary Steve Barclay have criticised their demands as unreasonable and unaffordable and ruled out holding any further talks with the BMA In July Barclay decided to impose a pay rise for 2023 24 averaging 8 8 on junior doctors as part of a plan to give most doctors and dentists in England an increase of at least 6 He said the junior doctors ballot result was extremely disappointing It would affect NHS staff and patients both of whom are shouldering the brunt of the BMA s relentless and now coordinated strike action The BMA on Thursday called on Sunak to step in and ensure that Barclay made junior doctors a credible offer that would allow talks to begin to reach an agreed settlement Dr Rob Laurenson and Dr Vivek Trivedi the joint chairs of its junior doctors committee warned Sunak and Barclay that their members would keep on striking until spring 2025 if need be Rishi Sunak now has nowhere to hide There can be no more delaying no more wasting time with impositions of pay deals no more declarations that strikes must end before even stepping in the room with us If he does not come to the table with a credible offer on pay he will face another six months of strike action And another six months after and after that if he continues to ignore us He knows the stakes he knows our ask and now he knows our resolve The prime minister faces a profession united in its determination to address pay erosion Consultants and junior doctors stand shoulder to shoulder in solidarity after months of facing the same inflexibility from government they said This article was amended on 4 September 2023 An earlier version said that consultants would strike on 1 October They are not striking on that date but will strike on 19 September and alongside junior doctors on 20 September and 2 3 and 4 October  Action will reduce services to Christmas Day levels of care for four days in September and

56|Choose Love review interactive Netflix romcom is a gimmick too far In theory an interactive romcom in which you choose the suitor and the confessions or evasions to get to them sounds like a good idea Who hasn t yelled not him or don t do that at the screen when bemoaning a misguided protagonist s choices Choose Love Netflix s romcom entry into its nascent interactive oeuvre following the Black Mirror episode Bandersnatch in 2019 at least tries to makes its choices seem organic to a theoretical audience s different tastes in romantic interests stable and sincere passionate and nostalgic or flirtatious and spontaneous But as proof of a concept that sounds admittedly like a consultant s pitch to streaming services it struggles to feel at all like a genuine story To be fair to the director Stuart McDonald and the screenwriter Josann McGibbon who had to conceive of an impressive number of twists and outcomes one per suitor plus the option of going solo there may be no way to overcome my distaste for having to make decisions for Cami Laura Marano a twentysomething audio producer with ennui for both her career and long term relationship with Paul Greek s Scott Michael Foster Then again there s nothing much to Cami beyond unwavering perkiness a wardrobe that feels bizarrely out of time or at least more suited for 2014 and the promise from a tarot reader of three different men to imminently choose from Regardless of a few inconsequential decisions truth or dare advise her niece to defend herself from a bully or brush it off you ll meet them There s Paul of course a steady divorce lawyer who s good with kids and down for marriage There s Jack Jordi Webber Cami s model gorgeous high school ex who has miraculously reappeared in LA after devoting himself to international humanitarian causes And then there s Rex Avan Jogia with a teetering British accent a famous musician in the lane of Rod Stewart parody and the only option with whom there seems to be any chemistry thank God there s a choice I guess Each nominally represents a different value Paul is commitment Rex is risk and Jack is passion and not much else as the texturing of Cami s life and character has the feel of cardboard The aesthetic is similarly chintzy the type of flatly lit and oversaturated style we ve come to associate with a certain swath of Netflix originals The overdrawn acting and stakes less swooning feel more in line with a tween aiming Disney movie than a romcom or maybe that s my association as both Marano and Jogia s careers originated at the network the film is rated PG One can sense Marano s noble effort to sell this set up as she toggles between wide eyed shock to furrowed brow to a number of winking fourth wall asides asking us to make her decision But there s little to sell and the interactive element eliminates the draw of mindless couch fare I will give points for effort and for entertaining the prospect of a female protagonist ultimately choosing to go solo but the concept of an interactive romcom at least of this Netflix variety feels dead on arrival Fizzy romcoms often rely on a suspension of both reality and judgment and importantly on the quirks and tangled messes of character Does Cami stick with Paul and lean into the solidity of long term love Does she follow the jolt of high school nostalgia and see what could ve been with Jack And also help impoverished children or something Does she take a bet on her dreams and trying singing with Rex None of it really matters if I m in the driver s seat I watch a romcom to see a character tumble through an unforeseen series of choices and fall under a spell not to have the lead be a vessel for myself Choose Love for all its intentions of originality ultimately feels like another poor conclusion of algorithmic content Already we re drowning in decisions endless options tailored to our viewing habits our history our taste Now oppression of choice has entered the frame and it s not fun Choose Love is now available on Netflix Viewers can take charge of a new romantic comedy picking the lead s moves but the fun of the idea quickly evaporates|7.0|12.0
57|Theresa May says she regrets using term hostile environment  Theresa May has expressed regret for using the term hostile environment and has criticised Home Office staff for an inbuilt cynicism she believes contributed to the Windrush scandal May devotes a chapter to the scandal which unfolded while she was prime minister in her forthcoming memoir The Abuse of Power She concludes that it was an abuse of power and describes the treatment of the Windrush generation who were wrongly classified as illegal immigrants as shocking The Conservative MP says she is profoundly sorry but in her 14 page analysis of what caused this abuse of power she seeks to spread responsibility attributing the problem to the failures of successive governments May blames Clement Attlee the Labour prime minister between 1945 and 1951 for failing to give Windrush arrivals paperwork to show their right to be in the UK and notes that Labour politicians created the concept of the hostile environment in the decade before she became home secretary in 2010 Much has been made of the use of the term hostile environment when I was home secretary May writes In retrospect it was not a good term to use It was suggested at a time when it was clear that it related to people were here illegally but of course it became a term that was used in relation to a generation who had every right to be here May appears to downplay the central significance of a series of hostile environment policies that she introduced while home secretary in the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts As result of the subsequent significant tightening of documentation checks thousands of people from the Windrush generation experienced difficulties accessing NHS healthcare benefits pensions and work Some were sacked from their jobs or evicted and some were wrongly detained and deported to countries they had left as children decades earlier May makes no mention of detentions or deportations in her chapter She asserts that she was not aware of any debate that pointed out there were people who had not been given evidence of their status here when they arrived and who would therefore be adversely affected by the 2014 and 2016 Immigration Acts Fiona Bawdon the author of Chasing Status a 2014 report highlighting the risks of the hostile environment legislation that May s Home Office was introducing said it was disingenuous to suggest that the department had not been warned I and others tried to alert the Home Office to what was happening four years before the Windrush scandal broke as it was already clear that people who had lived in the UK legally for decades were having their lives turned upside down she said They chose not to listen and displayed no curiosity until they were forced to by the Guardian s reporting in 2018 A Home Office source who worked in the department at the time said it was unfair to accuse officials of being overzealous in their approach when they were simply following rules designed by politicians The source asked Who was setting the tone May acknowledges that she only fully grasped the severity of the difficulties experienced by the Windrush generation when Sir Lenny Henry raised the issue at a service in April 2018 commemorating the 25th anniversary of the death of Stephen Lawrence May was sitting in the front row next to Meghan and Prince Harry when Henry demanded to know whether the government was going to sort out the problems being experienced by the Windrush generation which had already been headline news for over a week In his remarks to the congregation the actor Sir Lenny Henry made what was for me and others an uncomfortable reference to the Windrush issue she writes adding that she was disturbed to hear that Home Office officials were demanding four pieces of documentary proof for each year that someone had been in the UK I found it hard to believe it at the time and raised the issue with officials when I returned to No 10 Henry said he had made the comments spontaneously after discussing the scandal with Lawrence s father Neville I was turning over in my head what I might say if I were brave enough It felt like the right time to speak truth to power he said May describes as regrettable the decision this year by the current home secretary Suella Braverman to drop several key reform recommendations designed to ensure that the scandal could not be repeated Given the impact on the Windrush generation of the actions taken by the Home Office it was my view that the government should accept the recommendations in full she writes  Memoir blames Windrush scandal on Home Office staff and previous governments including Clement Attlee s|1.0|3.0

59|Dawid Malan hits out at nonsense omission by Rockets during Hundred After leading England s victory march in Wednesday s opening T20 against New Zealand with a half century Dawid Malan slammed the decision to drop him from the Trent Rockets team after four games of this year s Hundred as nonsense with it jeopardising a crucial international autumn Malan who turns 36 on Sunday admitted he had felt a bit rusty having only batted six times since June as a result of losing his place in the Rockets side That was hard to take Malan said It put me in a pretty bad place because the rest of the year I d been hitting the ball well and scoring runs everywhere and suddenly I m out of form because I ve had four bad innings which is a load of nonsense as I showed on Wednesday night Two days after what turned out to be his final appearance in the Hundred Malan was named in England s squad for both T20 and ODI series against New Zealand and by extension in the provisional group to travel to the World Cup It was definitely a relief he said Especially having sacrificed so many franchise tournaments over the last couple of years to get into this World Cup squad to get the call was extremely satisfying I ve worked really hard to get in that squad Every opportunity I ve been given in 50 overs in my last four or five series I ve gone and had to score the runs doing it the tough way to get in there Of England players to have made more than three ODI appearances in the last three years Malan has the best average by a huge margin he averages 57 3 in 17 innings with his closest challenger Jonny Bairstow s 47 9 in 13 at a similar strike rate and he sits third in the equivalent list in T20s Yet he does not feel his place in the World Cup squad is completely secure It s a provisional squad and from my understanding it s up to us to score runs to stay in it he said I think it would be tough two weeks before we are flying to suddenly lose your place but that s cricket and that s the way life goes Nothing is ever guaranteed until you stand on that plane England emerged from Wednesday s opening fixture with no injury concerns to carry into Friday s match at Old Trafford New Zealand s Devon Conway was hit on the leg by a Brydon Carse delivery and will be assessed before the second game of the series having not fielded at Chester le Street as a precaution  The batter said losing his place in Trent Rockets XI was hard to take and that he felt rusty in the first T20 against New Zealand but he helped England win|11.0|14.0
60|Lost in the political wilderness the Tories have no core values left Geoffrey Wheatcroft The natural party of government After five PMs in seven years the Conservatives seem all at sea 25 August wonders whether the Conservative party has run out of ideas The inescapable fact of demographic change means that the number of individuals who wish they were living in the 1950s and would choose to vote for a party of inequality is reducing by the day The Conservatives renowned shapeshifting has brought them this far but to become a party that believes in equality is a transformation that is beyond them Whether the Tories are nice or nasty isn t the issue The real issue is that they are an anachronism Dr Dominic Horne Ledbury Herefordshire Geoffrey Wheatcroft skirts around the fundamental reason for the failure of the current Conservative government It is more than lacking competence and ideas He is right to cite the 2019 purge of honourable people but above all it is down to being bereft of values and integrity It is worth noting Hermann Hesse s comment in his 1943 novel The Glass Bead Game which was rejected for publication in Germany at that time Hesse wrote People know or dimly feel that if thinking is not kept pure and keen and if respect for the world of the mind is no longer operative the engineer s slide rule and the computation of banks and stock exchanges will forfeit validity and authority and chaos will ensue It feels in many respects as though our country is not functioning as it should Let s hope for a change of government before chaos ensues Colin McCulloch Marlow Buckinghamshire The main reason the Tories are in power despite being responsible for a long series of utterly incompetent governments is that Labour has failed the nation Keir Starmer doesn t offer the real changes needed no ideas on housing no discussion about failing privatised services no real ideas to reduce the chaos in the NHS And he daren t even mention one of the main causes of the disaster Brexit But on that last point I blame Labour under Jeremy Corbyn Corbyn should have been telling people that their problems were nothing to do with the EU or immigrants The issues were created by the untrammelled neoliberal economics that the Tories under Margaret Thatcher set in motion and the 13 years of Labour government under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown failed to change So Britain s future is bleak a worthless opposition with no ideas for change will not unseat a Tory party with its support from the bulk of our press No change is coming David Reed London I am no fan of the Tory party but there is a certain residual pity for its longstanding membership which is ever decreasing to witness the party embroiled in divisive culture wars and lowest common denominator rhetoric I think it died on the Brexit hill because its arrogance would not countenance a less than wonderful future Geoffrey Wheatcroft is correct that something has indeed gone wrong or missing the Tories once reliable political compass moral or otherwise I suspect Now the party is left in the wilderness with no one to guide it out But MPs have only themselves to blame Judith A Daniels Great Yarmouth Norfolk Have an opinion on anything you ve read in the Guardian today Please email us your letter and it will be considered for publication in our letters section   strong Letters strong The party is an anachronism with a rapidly shrinking support base writes strong Dr Dominic Horne strong while strong Colin McCulloch strong says it is clear a change of government is needed Plus letters from strong David Reed strong and strong Judith A Daniels strong |16.0|3.0

70|Iceland allows whaling to resume in massive step backwards  Animal rights groups and environmentalists have described as hugely disappointing the news that Iceland has given the green light for commercial whaling to resume after a temporary ban introduced this year came to an end The Icelandic government said there will be tougher regulations in place including better equipment training and increased monitoring but campaigners said these were pointless and irrelevant because whales will still suffer agonising deaths The hunted whales are shot with grenade tipped harpoons The government s decision to allow the country s fin whale hunt to go ahead follows advice from a working group that improvements could reduce suffering Fin whales the world s second largest mammal after the blue whale are considered globally vulnerable to extinction according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature In a statement to the Guardian Iceland s minister of food and agriculture Svand s Svavarsd ttir said With the expiry of the ban the ministry is now implementing strict and detailed new requirements for hunting including equipment methods and increased supervision Irrespective of my personal or political standpoint on whaling evaluation of its future remains ongoing and the official process continues She stressed that the current permit was issued in 2019 before she took office and is valid to the end of 2023 adding A decision on any licenses being granted in 2024 has not yet been made These new measures are pointless and irrelevant said Luke McMillan an anti whaling campaigner at Whale and Dolphin Conservation Training education and better equipment or killing methods the measures they have put in place will never make whaling acceptable There is no humane way to kill whales at sea and they will still suffer This decision is hugely disappointing and a massive step backwards The groups stressed that whales already face myriad threats including pollution entanglement in fishing nets ship strikes and the climate crisis Ruud Tombrock the European director of the Humane Society International said It is inexplicable that minister Svavarsd ttir has dismissed the unequivocal scientific evidence that she herself commissioned demonstrating the brutality and cruelty of commercial whale killing There is simply no way to make harpooning whales at sea anything other than cruel and bloody and no amount of modifications will change that With the need for whale protection so critical this is a devastating rejection of a once in a generation opportunity to end the slaughter at sea There is a new shameful entry in the conservation history books Iceland had a chance to do the right thing and it chose not to Some conservationists are worried that Thursday s decision will put the longer term phasing out of whaling into question A decision about Iceland s whaling quota for the next several years is expected at the end of 2023 The country has only one remaining whaling company Hvalur Its five year licence to hunt fin whales expires in December However others see the decision as a step forward towards ending the industry in Iceland They say are confident that the new conditions will not be met and hope that the Icelandic government will stop issuing licences for whaling once Hvalur s permit runs out Patrick Ramage of the International Fund for Animal Welfare said This is a regrettable but required step towards a permanent end to Icelandic whaling The fisheries minister must now decide whether this cruel slaughter will be allowed to continue beyond this year All signs are that she is putting an orderly end to this bloody business It is not possible to demonstrate cruelty free whaling In June Svavarsd ttir suspended whaling until 31 August after a government commissioned report concluded that the hunt does not comply with Iceland s animal welfare legislation If the government and licensees cannot guarantee welfare requirements these activities do not have a future Svavarsd ttir said at the time She said last year that the country planned to end whaling from 2024 as demand dwindled The report on the country s fin whale hunt by the Icelandic food and veterinary authority in May found the killing of the animals took too long Some took two hours to die after being harpooned The agency questioned whether hunting large whales could meet animal welfare objectives After the suspension of the hunt an expert working group comprising the ministry of food the national food agency and the Norwegian fisheries agency was set up in July to examine whether it was possible to modify the whale hunt to reduce animal suffering A few days ago it concluded there were grounds for making changes to the hunting methods used to improve animal welfare Iceland Norway and Japan are the only countries that have continued whale hunting despite fierce criticism from environmentalists and animal rights defenders Support for whaling in Iceland has dropped dramatically A survey published in June indicated that 51 of Icelanders were opposed to the hunt and 29 in favour with the over 60s most in favour Last year in Iceland 148 fin whales were killed The hunting of 58 whales was filmed and analysed by experts on behalf of the food and veterinary authority It showed that of the 36 whales shot more than once five whales were shot three times and four whales were shot four times One whale with a harpoon in its back was chased for five hours  Activists say that whales will still suffer agonising deaths despite new regulations and monitoring|1.0|8.0
71|Grant Shapps appointed as defence secretary Grant Shapps has been chosen to replace Ben Wallace as defence secretary in a mini reshuffle of the cabinet prompting criticism from some Conservative MPs and former military figures about his lack of relevant experience The move handed Shapps his fifth cabinet post in a year with Claire Coutinho the outgoing children s minister and 2019 entrant MP picked to take over as energy secretary David Johnston another MP elected at the last election replaces Coutinho and will become the seventh children s minister in the past four years sparking further concerns about ministerial churn A reorganisation of Rishi Sunak s top team had been expected for weeks given Wallace s desire to step down It was scaled down insiders suggested to avoid any fallout threatening to blight the Conservative party conference in October Shapps was appointed on Thursday morning and within hours some Tory MPs and former service heads voiced concerns about his lack of first hand exposure to foreign affairs defence and security Richard Dannatt a former chief of the general staff of the British army and now a crossbench peer told Sky News that while Wallace understood defence well it would be a tricky brief for Shapps who over the past 12 months has also served as transport secretary home secretary for a week under Liz Truss and business secretary Now we have a new defence secretary who knows very little about defence and it s a complex portfolio it will take him quite some time to get up to speed Lord Dannatt said He later told BBC Radio 4 that the big question remained as to whether Shapps would put his loyalty to Sunak above pushing for the needs of the defence community Mark Francois a Conservative MP who is a member of the Commons defence committee said Shapps faced a very steep learning curve and many MPs had expected and wanted James Heappey the junior defence minister to be promoted Grant Shapps is a bright bloke but he s going to have to come up to speed very very quickly Francois told GB News A former cabinet minister also privately said they were completely underwhelmed by Shapps and it was baffling for other serving and former defence ministers to have been passed over given the war in Ukraine In his first comments on taking the role Shapps paid tribute to Wallace s enormous contribution to UK defence and global security over the past four years He added that he was looking forward to working with the brave men and women of our armed forces who defend our nation s security and continuing to support Ukraine Downing Street was reluctant to appoint a high profile Tory with military experience to replace Wallace Sources said they feared figures such as Penny Mordaunt and Tom Tugendhat who have both served in the armed forces would use the job to campaign for the leadership if Sunak lost the next election One Whitehall insider speaking on condition of anonymity was sceptical about the choice of Shapps The MoD has a really serious challenge around making ends meet while having to transform to match a much more serious threat they said This will likely exacerbate the current drift towards the next election But another former senior security official who worked with Shapps previously described the new defence secretary as a seasoned character who remained steady when things were hot and they emphasised that he would have to deal with many sensitive issues in his new job often demanding a swift response to apparent aggression Tory strategists suggested Shapps s promotion as evidence that Sunak was stepping up planning for a general election campaign They pointed to Shapps s record of delivery and communication as well as his being an attack dog who would take the fight to Labour Shapps is a keen user of TikTok which the government has banned on official devices Tobias Ellwood the chair of the defence select committee said Shapps would get the mother of all briefings when he entered the Ministry of Defence on Thursday I suspect he might have his phone not taken away from him but certainly he ll come out with less apps on his phone than when he walks in Ellwood added New defence secretaries are briefed first about the Trident nuclear programme its capabilities and the impact it can have although decisions on using the weapons are ultimately for the prime minister They are also told about their authority in terms of the use of force and over a longer period about possible threats from Russia China other hostile countries and international terrorism During last summer s Tory leadership race Shapps briefly took a tilt at replacing Boris Johnson However he failed to muster enough support to make it on to the MPs ballot In his pitch to Tory backbenchers Shapps pushed for defence spending to rise to 3 of gross domestic product saying Freedom is not free Nato recommends at least 2 and Sunak has committed to 2 5 in the long term Sunak had many run ins with Wallace over defence spending which the latter referred to in his resignation letter to the prime minister Wallace wrote I know you agree with me that we must not return to the days where defence was viewed as a discretionary spend by government and savings were achieved by hollowing out  Ben Wallace resignation prompts appointment of former energy secretary and mini cabinet reshuffle|3.0|3.0
72|Fire safety report demanded five changes on Bibby Stockholm Safety inspectors have demanded five urgent alterations to the Bibby Stockholm the giant barge meant to hold hundreds of people seeking asylum because of risks to their lives in the event of fire documents released under the Freedom of Information Act show Dorset and Wiltshire fire service examined the vessel in Portland Dorset after the first asylum seekers were taken on board three weeks ago Officials concluded in their fire inspection report released under FoI that lives could be put at risk because there were too few fire escapes a lack of fire drills and problems with air vents that would have to be rectified within weeks Home Office sources did not confirm whether the changes outlined in the report would be made Tim Naor Hilton chief executive of Refugee Action which obtained the report said No one should be forced to live cheek by jowl on what is effectively a prison ship even if it was 100 fire safe But it s appalling that ministers were happy to put people s safety at risk and move them on to a boat that had insufficient fire escapes problems with air vents and no strategy to conduct drills The Bibby Stockholm has become a floating statue of the government s failed strategy of cruelty This plan must be scrapped and people housed with dignity in our communities The Home Office this August denied firefighters claims that the vessel was a potential deathtrap On Wednesday the Guardian disclosed that hundreds of people could be moved on to the Bibby Stockholm despite an inspection finding plumbing problems that could take months to repair In the fire service s report which was sent to the barge s contractors Landry and Kling on 10 August and copied to the Home Office inspectors said five changes had to be implemented within a month The audit identified that some people were at risk in case of fire and improvements are required to provide additional safety The improvements should be completed within 1 months sic of this letter The changes include reinstating an alternative escape route from the stern of the barge leading from the canteen The provision of exits from the canteen dining room is inadequate for the number of people who may be required to use them This means that people may not be able to escape safely in case of fire the inspector wrote The contractor was told to install easy to open door securing mechanisms for 10 bedrooms saying that people requiring to use these doors in an emergency may not be able to open them easily preventing them from escaping safely Vents that could be manually opened by fire crews had to be built into two main escape routes on the barge the report said Protected stairways require a means to ventilate any residual smoke that may enter the stairway during evacuation or firefighting operations it said A fire resistant wall had to be reinstated the report said because otherwise fire and smoke could spread rapidly from the store which could enter the escape routes and make them unsafe for people to use exposing them to harm And regular fire drills had to be held day and night If people do not understand what to do in case of fire they may behave inappropriately if fire breaks out the report said Matt Wrack general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union said the report vindicated the union s demand for a meeting to discuss fire safety He said Our requests were denied and ministers instead engaged in a disgraceful vindictive attempt to claim that our serious fire safety concerns were politically motivated Everyone has the right to go to sleep at night knowing that proper fire safety measures are in place regardless of where they are from The government must rethink its reckless approach to fire hazards on the barge The inspector s demands for work came days after the first asylum seekers entered the barge and appear to contradict claims this week from Suella Braverman the home secretary that the Home Office had followed protocols in anticipation of embarkation Let me be clear that I m confident barges are safe Braverman told BBC Breakfast on Monday This barge has accommodated people in the past asylum seekers oil rig workers and barges of this kind have been used to accommodate asylum seekers for example in Scotland So I m very confident that this barge is safe for human habitation We followed all of the advice and protocols in anticipation of embarkation A Home Office spokesperson said The health and welfare of asylum seekers remains of the utmost priority and we are working closely with external partners and Dorset and Wiltshire fire service to further improve safety measures on the vessel The Bibby Stockholm successfully completed all fire and safety checks ahead of the first individuals boarding The vessel completed a statutory inspection and refurbishment before undergoing final preparations to accommodate asylum seekers  Documents released under FoI laws show officials concerns after first asylum seekers boarded|16.0|6.0

77|What is Raac and why is it forcing schools to shut buildings  Ministers have ordered schools to immediately shut buildings made with aerated concrete until safety work is undertaken The decision could see thousands of pupils at more than 100 schools in England begin the autumn term taking lessons remotely What is reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete Raac Raac is a lightweight bubbly form of concrete that is usually found in roofs and occasionally in walls and floors It looks like standard concrete but compared with the traditional reinforced material which is typically denser Raac is weak and less durable The material was favoured in construction projects because of its lightweight thermal properties Where is Raac found Schools hospitals and various other public buildings from the 1950s to the mid 1990s were built using Raac A National Audit Office NAO report earlier this year said the concrete had been confirmed in at least 65 schools in England after 196 completed surveys with 24 requiring emergency action The number of schools at risk was expected to increase significantly when the results of surveys of 572 schools with suspected Raac were completed by the Department for Education DfE More than a third 38 of school buildings 24 000 are past their estimated design lifespan according to the NAO Why is it dangerous Experts say the building material is less durable than reinforced concrete and deteriorates over time so is susceptible to sudden failure It has a life expectancy of little more than 30 years and this means buildings constructed from the 1950s to the 1990s that have not been checked by structural engineers are at risk of collapse The danger has previously been considered so great that a number of schools have had to close either fully or partly while others have required emergency propping up owing to fears of collapse The material is also prone to collapse when wet which can happen if there are leaks in a building s roof Have there been warnings Attention turned to the use of the material in schools in 2018 when the roof of a primary school in Kent collapsed 24 hours after signs of structural stress began to appear Four schools in Essex and the north east of England were shut in April and June after RAAC was discovered in their ceilings according to Schools Week a digital newspaper Surveys to determine the presence and condition of the Raac used in the buildings have been taking place since March last year What is the overall condition of school buildings in England Schools across the country are in poor condition with many containing asbestos or in need of urgent repairs In 2019 the DfE referred 676 state funded schools and academies in England to the national health and safety body over concerns they were failing to safely manage asbestos in their buildings in line with regulatory requirements putting thousands of staff and pupils at risk About 90 of school buildings in England are thought to contain asbestos often around pipes and boilers and in wall and ceiling tiles The Health and Safety Executive HSE advises that it is a risk only if it is disturbed or damaged which releases fibres into the air In 2019 a Guardian investigation found that more than one in six schools in England required urgent repairs After a series of inspections surveyors found that almost 4 000 schools across England were in need of immediate restoration work on roofs walls or windows which were deemed in need of immediate replacement or repair Many more schools were found not to have the appropriate safety paperwork required by law including electrical test certificates fire risk assessments or asbestos management plans What has been done In June ministers launched a UK government wide inquiry into the use of Raac in public buildings to look into how many of the thousands of government buildings were constructed with it More than 14 900 schools built during the period when the use of Raac was widespread in construction were the DfE s main focus  Reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete is prone to sudden failure when it deteriorates and many of school buildings in England are past designed lifespan|1.0|19.0

liars in a social media post Beccy Speight the chief executive of the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds said she did not approve the post on X formerly known as Twitter that said the UK prime minister the levelling up secretary Michael Gove and the environment secretary Th r se Coffey were liars The tweet continued You said you wouldn t weaken environmental protections And yet that s just what you are doing You lie and you lie and you lie again On Thursday morning Speight told BBC Radio 4 s Today programme There are lots of things happening at the moment and one of them is this proposal from the government to amend the habitat regulations to disapply the requirements for nutrient neutrality The reason that has made us so frustrated and led to that original tweet is that it completely goes against the commitments that the government has made many times in the past not to weaken environmental protections most recently when the retained EU law bill was going through in the summer So this completely contravenes those commitments and that s what s led us to be so frustrated and so angry about the proposed amendment coming through The reason that we issued our apology is that we do believe that the nature of public discourse does matter and that we have a role to play in that and that we campaign on policy not on people So the framing of that tweet where we called out individual people we felt was incorrect and inappropriate and we apologise for that The Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar has accused the UK government of playing politics in relation to drug consumption rooms which allow people struggling with addiction to safely take drugs under supervision A report from the home affairs committee at Westminster published on Thursday backed proposals for drug consumption rooms staffed by medical professionals to offer treatment services A possible facility has been discussed in Glasgow for years but requires an exemption to the Misuse of Drugs Act from the Home Office to go forward If the UK government is not willing to support such a move the committee said the relevant powers should be devolved to Holyrood Sarwar said the Scottish government could move ahead with consumption facilities now He said I think there is a way forward here that allows us to pilot safe consumption rooms in Glasgow and other parts of the country that does not require the devolution of our drug laws It requires as the lord advocate has already highlighted a change in terms of how you would have a presumption against prosecution I think that is a much more co operative way forward if we are serious about tackling the issue One drug death is one drug death too many To have the highest drug deaths anywhere in western Europe anywhere in the UK is utterly unacceptable I m sick and tired of politicians wanting to play politics with these people s lives rather than help save these people s lives Responding to the report a spokesperson for the Home Office said There is no safe way to take illegal drugs which devastate lives ruin families and damage communities and we have no plans to consider this Our 10 year drugs strategy set out ambitious plans backed with a record 3bn funding over three years to tackle the supply of illicit drugs through relentless policing action and building a world class system of treatment and recovery to turn people s lives around and prevent crime Under the committee s recommendations Glasgow would operate a pilot of the facilities that could then be expanded across the UK funded by government north and south of the border A former chief of the general staff of the British army said that questions remained about what sort of defence secretary Grant Shapps would be Speaking to BBC Radio 4 s World at One programme Lord Dannatt said The big question is whether he s going to be a politician first and foremost or whether he s going to be looking after the defence needs of the country If Rishi Sunak has appointed Grant Shapps to be a supporter in cabinet to go quietly on defence and to be a smooth voice on Radio 4 as we run up to the election that s one thing But if he s going to properly understand the needs of defence as Ben Wallace has pointed out in his resignation letter and over the four years that he was secretary of state of defence we do need to spend more money on our defence Is Grant Shapps going to fight their corner in cabinet or is he going to come quietly and play the political game The senior Tory MP Tobias Ellwood has backed the new defence secretary Grant Shapps to succeed in the role The chair of the Commons defence committee told BBC Radio 4 s World at One programme he was speaking in a personal capacity as he rejected concerns about Shapps knowledge of military matters He said He s a very competent and capable minister He understands the Whitehall machine He s actually one of the best communicators that is in the cabinet at the moment He sits on or has sat on the national security council as well He s a pilot so very familiar with the air domain too and indeed was coincidentally in Ukraine in Kyiv last week talking about nuclear power and other aspects too so very familiar with what s going on I don t need to remind everybody that he will be surrounded by one of the most professional civil service machines in the world Nadhim Zahawi is in line to become chair of the Daily Telegraph and the Sunday Telegraph after brokering a deal between Middle Eastern investors and the Barclay family according to reports The Barclays are thought to be attempting to regain control of the media group with financial support from investors in the United Arab Emirates months after surrendering the debt laden business to Lloyds Banking Group Lloyds Banking Group put the Telegraph s holding company into receivership in June after the breakdown of talks with the family On Thursday the Times reported that the MP and former chancellor had been involved as a middle man in the financing deal raising the prospect of Zahawi becoming chair of the titles if the Barclays are successful in buying back around 1bn of debt owed to Lloyds The Labour party has spent more than half a million pounds as part of its lawsuit against five former staffers accused of leaking an internal report on antisemitism the Guardian understands The 508 000 spent so far follows a bitter battle between Labour and ex staff members including Jeremy Corbyn s former chief of staff Karie Murphy and his former director of communications Seumas Milne The total includes 300 000 spent on a failed application to gain access to Murphy s private emails The party has been refused permission to appeal In a high court order handed down this month Mr Justice Chamberlain ordered the party to pay 90 000 as an interim contribution towards Murphy s costs Murphy Milne and the three others Georgie Robertson Laura Murray and Harry Hayball deny leaking the report by Labour s governance and legal unit in April 2020 In a tweet the new energy secretary Claire Coutinho said she is delighted to be appointed to the post I will work with the Prime Minister to safeguard our energy security reduce bills for families and build cleaner cheaper homegrown energy she wrote Claire Coutinho s promotion to energy security and net zero secretary means she is just the latest minister to depart the children and families brief in recent years The prime minister has already appointed David Johnston as her replacement at the Department for Education but the reshuffle has not been well received within the sector Neil Leitch the chief executive of the Early Years Alliance said While we congratulate Claire Coutinho on her promotion the fact that the early years will soon be on its tenth minister in as many years is beyond frustrating for the sector The fact that government expects providers to put up with a never ending revolving door of ministers is bad enough but to do so as the sector prepares to roll out its biggest early years expansion in recent history is bordering on negligent What we need more than ever over the coming months is consistent policy driven by ministers who have a clear understanding of the early years sector and the challenges it faces This reshuffle is likely to deliver the exact opposite Purnima Tanuku the chief executive of National Day Nurseries Association said With the news of the sudden departure of Claire Coutinho from the childcare brief we are back to square one This is really distressing for the early years sector to have their minister moved at such a crucial time just seven months from the expansion of funded childcare for two year olds The new minister David Johnston will be the eighth we have had within five years Childcare and early education must be a priority and must be given some stability and focus Mr Johnston will need to get to grips very quickly with the key financial and workforce challenges plaguing the sector in order to make this expansion a success for children parents and providers With his background in the Social Mobility Commission and Education select committee we hope he will hit the ground running and work closely with the sector to support them to give children the best start in life Since her appointment as education minister Claire Coutinho has engaged well with the sector and its challenges speaking at our conference and visiting many nurseries We wish her well in her new role Climate campaigners Friends of the Earth said good riddance to Grant Shapps and expressed hope that his replacement as energy security secretary Claire Coutinho will oversee a change in the department Dave Timms the head of political affairs at Friends of the Earth said Good riddance to Grant Shapps He seemed to be more concerned with playing childish politics on social media than the serious policies needed to address the greatest challenge of our time He has promoted new drilling for oil and gas against the advice of his own climate advisers allowed speculation about whether vital deadlines for the transition to electric vehicles and heat pumps would be stuck to and failed to invest in home insulation The country needs a serious secretary of state that will step up to give the certainty and support that businesses and people need to invest in the changes that will cut both emissions and the cost of living We hope Claire Coutinho will be that person Meanwhile WWF s executive director of advocacy and campaigns Kate Norgrove said After a summer of drift the new energy security and net zero secretary must rapidly increase the pace of delivering the UK s climate commitments The evidence shows us that acting now on our climate commitments is good for nature brings economic opportunities and supports and helps household finances We look forward to working with the new secretary of state to seize the economic opportunity of the 21st century Labour has suspended one of its most troubled constituency parties after alleged rule breaking in the run up to the next general election the Guardian can reveal The Leicester East constituency Labour party CLP which has been represented by the disgraced parliamentarians Keith Vaz and Claudia Webbe is the subject of an internal investigation by the party s headquarters senior sources have confirmed Local party officials were expected to choose their next parliamentary party candidate over the next few months but a shortlist was now expected to be imposed by Labour headquarters instead sources said The inquiry follows concerns over Labour s performance in the city s local elections in May when it lost 22 council seats and the Conservatives gained 17 bucking the national trend The city s three parliamentary seats were retained by Labour at the last election but in Leicester East the party s majority fell from 22 428 in 2017 to 6 019 in 2019 Ed Miliband has criticised the rapid turnover of ministers in the energy portfolio In a post on X formerly known as Twitter the shadow climate secretary said I congratulate Claire Coutinho on her appointment as Energy Secretary But it speaks volumes about the failures of Tory policy that we are now onto the 6th Secretary of State since 2019 Reshuffling of the deckchairs will not deliver the proper energy policy Britain needs The new Energy Secretary needs to recognise that Grant Shapps approach has been a disaster and distance the government from it Shapps opposition to clean homegrown power has damaged Britain s energy security and his attempt to have a culture war has alarmed businesses The shadow attorney general Emily Thornberry said the reshuffle is just moving the deckchairs and the government is still a sinking ship Speaking to broadcasters in Westminster she said It really doesn t matter how many new jobs Rishi Sunak gives to his friends It s still just moving the deckchairs They re still a sinking ship In other news the release of the book written by Nadine Dorries on the downfall of Boris Johnson will be delayed slightly publisher HarperCollins has confirmed The former MP s book titled The Plot The Political Assassination Of Boris Johnson had been scheduled to be released on 28 September just before the Conservative party conference It will now be released on 9 November PA Media reports HarperCollins said that a small delay is necessary to allow for the huge volume of material the author has consulted the number of high level sources spoken to and the required legal process needed to share her story The foreign secretary has paid tribute to Ben Wallace describing him as a rock solid figure for our country James Cleverly wrote on X formerly known as Twitter Ben you ve been a rock solid figure for our country our party and for the Ukrainian people You ve defined what it means to serve your country Thank you Grant Shapps knows very little about defence and it will take him quite some time to get

defence secretary who knows very little about defence and it s a complex portfolio It will take him quite some time to get up to speed I think there is a risk that certainly the debate on resources for defence stagnates at least until Grant Shapps can get his head around his portfolio He went on I think what the chief of defence staff and the single service chiefs will be hoping from the new secretary of state for defence is that he will listen to the concerns that they have within the wider context of the insecurity of the world And although he may well have been appointed as someone who is going to support the prime minister and help the Conservative party in its general election campaign they will be hoping that he will really understand defence and push the case for defence not just for the Ministry of Defence s own benefit but for the benefit of the whole country Because there is a very strong case that we should be investing more in defence than we currently are Ben Wallace knew that Ben Wallace was arguing for it Is that discussion going to continue Or will Grant Shapps choose to go quietly The Tory MP David Johnston has been appointed parliamentary under secretary of state at the Department for Education replacing the promoted Claire Coutinho Johnston who was first elected in December 2019 and represents Wantage takes on the vacated role in Rishi

decade of Conservative failure The Labour frontbencher said on X formerly known as Twitter I congratulate Grant Shapps today The first duty of any government is to keep our country safe amp I will always work with the new Defence Secretary on this basis especially on Ukraine But after 13 years of Tory defence failures a change at the top will not change this record Grant Shapps said he is honoured to become defence secretary and praised Ben Wallace for his time in the role Shapps tweeted I m honoured to be appointed as Defence Secretary by Rishi Sunak I d like to pay tribute to the enormous contribution Ben Wallace has made to UK defence amp global security over the last 4 years As I get to work at DefenceHQ I am looking forward to working with the brave men and women of our Armed Forces who defend our nation s security And continuing the UK s support for Ukraine in their fight against Putin s barbaric invasion Grant Shapps has been confirmed as the new defence secretary after Ben Wallace s resignation earlier today The prime minister Rishi Sunak has moved quickly to appoint Shapps who most recently served in the cabinet as the energy security secretary He has previously served as the home secretary for six days in Liz Truss s ill fated cabinet business secretary transport secretary and chairman of the Tory party among a number of junior ministerial roles since 2010 Wallace had served for just over two years before stepping down this morning ahead of an expected mini reshuffle Claire Coutinho the minister for children has just entered Downing Street amid today s expected mini reshuffle If Grant Shapps is appointed as defence secretary as expected the East Surrey MP could replace him as energy security secretary The former prime minister Boris Johnson paid tribute to the outgoing defence secretary Ben Wallace while saying the energy security secretary Grant Shapps would be an excellent replacement Johnson tweeted Sad to see departure of my friend Ben Wallace A fine Defence Secretary who got so many calls right especially on Ukraine Grant Shapps is an excellent choice to succeed him Another name being strongly linked with the now vacant defence secretary role is Grant Shapps the energy security secretary who was seen entering Downing Street just before 9am He has been a familiar figure throughout the various Tory prime minister s cabinets in recent years also serving as business secretary transport secretary and even home secretary for less than a week under Liz Truss And now he appears likely to take on the defence job Stay tuned Among the candidates to replace Wallace as defence secretary is Liam Fox Fox was the defence secretary in 2010 under the then prime minister David Cameron but resigned because of his unusual working relationship with his best man Adam Werritty Another name being mentioned is James Heappey a former army major who served in Afghanistan and who previously served as Boris Johnson s parliamentary private secretary The chief secretary to the Treasury John Glen has also been linked with the post He has previously worked as an under secretary for arts heritage and tourism and the city minister A year ago Ben Wallace was seen as a potential candidate to replace Boris Johnson after the former PM s resignation Wallace was tipped as a possible favourite following his handling of the Russia Ukraine war and topped a ConservativeHome poll of Tory party members about who should become the next prime minister He was a staunch remainer and ruled himself out of the race to become PM that was initially won by Liz Truss saying I didn t want it enough I think at my stage in life to want to be prime minister you have to really really want it You have to want it above all else to be ruthless at one level I can be ruthless in certain things But I have three teenage children my wife and I had separated so no one s going to come and live with me in Chequers Wallace left school at 18 and became a ski instructor in Austria before attending the Royal Military Academy at Sandhurst He joined the Scots Guards in 1991 and served in Germany Cyprus Belize and Northern Ireland He left in 1998 to pursue a political career and was elected a year later as a member of the Scottish parliament where he served a single term He later moved to Lancashire and was elected as the MP for Lancaster and Wyre in 2005 He was appointed defence minister four years ago and his profile rose with evacuation of UK forces from Afghanistan and Russia s invasion of Ukraine The prime minister Rishi Sunak will appoint a new defence secretary after Wallace s formal resignation He praised Wallace s strategic foresight in dealing with Vladimir Putin and the Ukraine war and said he played an instrumental role in the evacuation of Afghanistan In his resignation letter Wallace points to his handling of threats including the Salisbury poisonings Afghanistan Sudan and Ukraine and points to increased funding he secured for the armed forces But he warns against cutting investment in the armed forces saying he believes over the next decade the world will get more insecure and more unstable Ever since I joined the Army I have dedicated myself to serving my country That dedication however comes at a personal toll to me and my family After much reflection I have taken the decision to ask that I be allowed to step down I won my seat in 2005 and after so many years it is time for me to invest in the parts of life that I have neglected and to explore new opportunities Ben Wallace has confirmed his resignation as defence secretary after four years in the post saying the Ministry of Defence is back on the path to being once again world class The move is likely to lead to a mini reshuffle with the chief secretary to the Treasury John Glen and the former defence secretary Liam Fox in the mix to replace him Wallace played a key role in responding to Russia s invasion of Ukraine and was a close ally of Boris Johnson but told the Sunday Times in July he was not standing next time However he ruled out leaving parliament prematurely and forcing another byelection on Rishi Sunak of whom he remains supportive  Energy secretary appointed defence secretary in mini reshuffle with Claire Coutinho taking the energy security brief|3.0|3.0
80| We ve become one big family Camp Wonky continues watch of Crooked House site Affectionately named Camp Wonky a group of Black Country residents are nearing the end of their second week keeping a 24 7 watch of the site where the Crooked House pub stood It s not exactly how I expected to be spending my summer laughed Emma Smith from Kingswinford who has been visiting the camp every day with her young daughter But we ve become one big family it s been nice And now we can see what s going on with the pub we all feel a lot happier we can actually sleep at night A month on from when the pub was gutted by fire this weekend the group will hold a locking ceremony in which approximately 23 000 bricks that have been salvaged from the site will be enclosed in two metal containers Campaigners will place their own padlocks on the containers to ensure the bricks will not be touched until they are satisfied a rebuild is going to take place They believe it will be the first step in a long journey to getting the famous wonky building rebuilt on the site where it stood for more than 250 years It s been agreed the bricks will stay where they are and our hope is that at some point in time we ll be getting them back out again to start rebuilding said Paul Turner one of the campaign leaders But there are a lot of hurdles to jump through before then Turner said that when a building company arrived on the site of the former pub which was demolished less than two days after the fire local residents feared the rubble would end up in landfill But South Staffordshire council has placed restrictions on the site that mean no materials can be removed without permission and workers have gone through the rubble by hand to carefully pack up all the bricks One local who has been keeping a watchful eye on the proceedings is Rob Brown who has been living in his van just outside the site gates to monitor goings on during the night I m getting messages from all over the world saying we re doing a cracking job he said I loved that pub I have many memories of it Those camped outside the gates have had a constant stream of visitors as well as donations and food Black Country folk we stick together especially in times like this Brown said She will be rebuilt she will Last week West Midlands police announced that two people had been arrested on suspicion of arson in relation to the fire The push to have the pub rebuilt shows no sign of abating We expected the momentum to drop after two or three days but that didn t happen it s still going strong And it s not just local it s national and international Turner said We just have to keep on pushing so that the powers that be support our cause We just don t have a lot of information about the legal side of things so we have to trust the work is going on behind the scenes  Locals are monitoring site 24 7 and are ready to lock up 23 000 bricks they hope can be used in a rebuild|1.0|6.0

84|The people of Ecuador just made climate justice history The world can follow Days ago voters in Ecuador approved a total ban on oil drilling in protected land in the Amazon a 2 5m acre tract in the Yasun national park that might be the world s most important biodiversity hotspot The area is a Unesco designated biosphere reserve and home to two non contacted Indigenous groups This could be a major step forward for the entire global climate justice movement in ways that are not yet apparent This vote is important not only for Ecuador and for the Indigenous peoples in the Yasun who now have hope of living in peace in perpetuity It is also a potential model for how we can use the democratic process around the world to help slow or even stop the expansion of fossil fuels to the benefit of billions of people The Yasun referendum proves that real democracy that respects the popular will can be a powerful tool for transitioning to a sustainable future Ecuador s state oil company Petroecuador had been producing nearly 60 000 barrels a day in the Yasun It now must figure out how to dismantle its entire operation and go home When in history has a popular vote ever forced an oil company to cease active drilling Never The Yasun vote was not the result of a business decision made in a boardroom or government office It was the product of two decades of grassroots organizing by citizens and activists like you and me I know because I have been to Ecuador more than 250 times to work on a historic pollution case against Chevron on behalf of the Indigenous people there Many of the same Indigenous leaders and activists who helped fight Chevron organized the Yasun vote At the same time the vote underscores how important it is to protect our increasingly fragile democracy Without a robust democracy that allows citizens to place issues of critical importance on the ballot without the intermediation of elites the Yasun referendum never would have happened The flipside is that powerful oil and gas companies understand the threat a real citizen based democracy poses to their power They fear a society where citizens can put referendums on the ballot without the approval of business leaders Those of us in the climate movement often can t even stop to focus on the connection between democracy and climate justice because we re so focused on dealing with the immediate crises taking place before our eyes such as the Maui fire In the United States it is not broadly known that the fossil fuel industry quietly funds a national lobbying campaign that has introduced draconian anti protest bills in at least 18 states These laws threaten anyone protesting at an oil or gas facility with huge fines and serious prison sentences some states even impose criminal liabilities on non profit advocacy groups that support the protesters These are really laws of intimidation designed to stop protest before it happens And they are also manifesting in other countries including Australia the United Kingdom and Germany As a result many Americans who have committed peaceful acts of non violent civil disobedience central to the birth of our country and a cornerstone of our political tradition now face decades in prison In Atlanta Georgia 42 people have been charged by prosecutors with domestic terrorism for trying to save the city s last green canopy in the Weelaunee forest Local police are trying to raze part of the forest to build a military style police training academy colloquially called Cop City that already resulted in the first police killing of a climate activist in US history The police have said that the activist Manuel Paez Ter n was used a weapon activists dispute that claim The Atlanta cases represent a frightening escalation of attacks on free speech and protest in the US None of those charged whom authorities accused mainly of vandalism and arson committed a direct act of violence against another person Nobody was injured other than the activist shot and killed by police while sitting in the forest That this is happening in a city considered to be one of the cradles of the American civil rights movement shows just how entwined corporate and police power have become in their efforts to erode democratic rights The prosecutions in Georgia are also occurring in a broader context where the right to vote has been seriously impaired Voter suppression is now a regular feature in many US states with ludicrous laws being passed to throw out votes In this short century two presidents have taken office in the US who did not win the popular vote Votes are constantly thrown out for the thinnest of reasons as journalists such as Greg Palast have meticulously documented On top of these threats to democracy at the state level the US supreme court and its unelected mostly far right justices are weakening both our democracy and its ability to regulate the fossil fuel industry The court has consistently approved measures like voter ID laws and felon disenfranchisement that make it more difficult for historically marginalized groups to vote It has also of late decided its role is to strike down popular legislation so who knows what they d do to a popularly won ban on oil drilling I am an environmental justice and human rights lawyer but one reason I spend significant time focused on issues of democracy is because I simply cannot do my work if our political system does not allow the political space to advocate freely After I helped Indigenous peoples win a major pollution case in Ecuador I was detained for almost three years in the US after being targeted with the nation s first ever corporate prosecution My own case is a reminder that the normal rules of democracy can easily be suspended when entrenched economic interests face a serious enough threat to their bottom line As I write this a heat dome in the US sits over the entire midwest and is affecting 100 million people Fires have destroyed millions of acres of land A tropical storm just smacked southern California for the first time and the historic town of Lahaina in Hawaii burned to the ground with hundreds of people still unaccounted for In the meantime the oil industry is reporting record profits creating enormous incentives for a small group of powerful shareholders to maintain their power by shrinking our democratic space What the referendum in Ecuador teaches us is that democratic processes when coupled with strong grassroots organizing can produce startlingly effective results Taking a cue from our friends in that brave country the next major move for the climate justice movement could be to launch a national campaign to put the simple question presented in Ecuador before the American people in every state that allows citizens to place their own questions on the ballot The question is whether we can vote to end the destruction of our planet by the burning of fossil fuels It is clear we cannot trust either of the two major US political parties both of which mostly support fossil fuel expansion to adequately address this crisis We simply cannot save the planet without first protecting and strengthening our democracy Steven Donziger is a human rights and environmental lawyer a Guardian US columnist and the creator of the Substack newsletter Donziger on Justice He is speaking at the New York Society for Ethical Culture on 12 September Voters won a huge battle with the oil industry proving that we can t save the planet without robust democracy|1.0|16.0
85|When is a vandal not a vandal When they re attacking Ulez cameras say desperate Tory MPs This was crime week on the Tory grid but the party of law and order is no more Tories now do like dictators passing draconian laws against the freedom to protest but flouting them for protesters of their own political ilk Self styled blade runners claim to have so far destroyed 600 cameras of the 3 000 needed to enforce the new Ulez ultra low emission zone now covering all of Greater London The Mail Telegraph and Sun have been whooping up the actions of Captain Gatso and his balaclavaed vandals as they tear down cameras and cut cables The Sun reports anti Ulez exploits along with its Give Us A Brake campaign to slow down the government s ruinous race to net zero The Telegraph quotes a vigilante describing his night time vandalism as unpaid voluntary work for the community This is what protesters do when they find no better way to alert the public to their cause accepting the consequences if caught But from suffragettes blowing up letter boxes to Extinction Rebellion XR spilling black paint outside the Department for Levelling Up Housing and Communities property damage is always roundly condemned by elected politicians So it s dumbfounding for senior Tory politicians at Westminster and in local authorities to encourage acts of criminal damage Iain Duncan Smith says he backs a lot of people in my constituency who have been cementing up cameras and putting plastic bags over them I am happy for them to do it because they are facing an imposition that no one wants and they have been lied to about it People have had enough It is hard to remember an MP of any party exhorting inciting or even praising criminal damage let alone a former cabinet minister and easy to forget a former Conservative party leader Raj Chada a solicitor specialising in protest who has defended protesters in movements including Black Lives Matter Colston Must Go XR and Just Stop Oil says he knows of no Labour MP ever advocating criminal damage I sat in court beside John McDonnell a few years ago as we were both character witnesses for a group of climate protesters both of us describing their non violent peaceful protest contrary to the prosecution case But just imagine if McDonnell ever gave an interview calling on his constituents to rise up and smash public property Duncan Smith is not alone The newly elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip Steve Tuckwell has been an administrator for Facebook groups urging more people to join in Ulez camera destruction groups hosting racist abuse of Sadiq Khan such as he hates our way of life thats why he s destroying London along with his muslim friends in County Hall When the Evening Standard contacted Conservative head office Tuckwell rapidly withdrew from the group A string of Tory council leaders have been administrators of similar anti Ulez sites A line is crossed when democratically elected politicians rouse people to disobey democratically made laws That s something the left has not always understood when raging at Labour MPs failing to join protests that might tip into illegality So it is breathtaking to find Duncan Smith law and order tough guy punisher of any benefit claimant who misses an appointment openly calling for protesters to commit criminal damage after voting through ferocious new anti protester laws designed to frighten off demonstrators Remember two Just Stop Oil protesters are in jail for three years and two years seven months for climbing on to a bridge and disrupting traffic Yet now some Conservative MPs are saying that police resources are being used to investigate attacks on Ulez cameras rather than more serious crimes I don t recall them saying the police wasted time prosecuting climate protesters Incidentally Duncan Smith told GB News that Ulez is a fund raiser that will damage the lives of people particularly the poor Ah the poor Who owe so much to his hostile ministrations Watch out for frequent Tory crocodile tears for poor people to resist net zero actions They never suggest making them less poor London s dirty air harms the poorest people most they are least likely to own cars and are disproportionately represented among those whose premature deaths are contributed to by air pollution 4 000 Londoners in 2019 alone Watch the Tories make Ulez their testing ground for the general election cleaner and greener versus the great British motorist Will it work YouGov finds nearly a third of Londoners back Ulez camera vandals But the Ulez policy itself has a net support of five percentage points across London as a whole Look at the marked difference between inner London where Ulez is well bedded in and supported by 62 of people and outer London where 51 oppose it That suggests that once Ulez has been running a while people forget the lies told about it In Uxbridge Tories raised fears that everyone would pay but voters will find only one in 10 vehicles affected with scrappage grants for most people Outer Londoners will find good effects nitrogen dioxide levels along roads are 21 lower in inner London and 46 lower in central London than they would have been without the Ulez Here is Allister Heath the editor of the Sunday Telegraph very excited at finding a new cause now that Brexit is dying of its own delusions The mayor s nasty vindictive Ulez cash grab has triggered a wave of French style civil disobedience radicalised an outer suburbia that the snooty inner London elite had long forgotten even existed Can revving up a motorists revolution do what Brexit did before This may only appeal to Torydom s basest base male and violent in tone The country ranks the climate high among its top concerns Ipsos finding it actually jumped 13 points in August putting it at third place with immigration fifth If the Tories make green the turf of the next election bring it on Labour will embrace it because net zero is right and goes with the grain of most opinion And as Napoleon said never interrupt your enemy when they are making a mistake This article was amended on 3 September 2023 An earlier version said that the Ulez scrappage grants scheme was available to all residents of London In fact the vehicle must be registered at the applicant s address with the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency on or before 30

87| Scent of eternity scientists recreate balms used on ancient Egyptian mummy Museum goers are to be transported back more than 3 500 years in a sniff after researchers identified and recreated the scent of balms used in the mummification of an ancient Egyptian noblewoman While mummification may conjure up scenes of bandages and jars the process was a fragrant affair in which the body and organs were embalmed to preserve them for the afterlife However with a dearth of texts from ancient Egypt revealing the exact ingredients used scientists have been using modern analyses to unpick the substances involved Now researchers studying residues of balms used in the mummification of a noblewoman called Senetnay have not only revealed that many of their ingredients came from outside Egypt but also reproduced their perfume Senetnay s mummification balm stands out as one of the most intricate and complex balms from that era said Barbara Huber the first author of the research from the Max Planck Institute of Geoanthropology Writing in the journal Scientific Reports the team say Senetnay lived around 1450BC and was a wet nurse to Pharaoh Amenhotep II Senetnay s canopic jars vessels in which the deceased s mummified organs were stored were discovered in a tomb in the Valley of the Kings in 1900 by Howard Carter the British archeologist who would later become famous for his role in discovering the tomb of Tutankhamun Huber and colleagues analysed six samples of residues of the mummification balms from inside two jars that that had once contained Senetnay s lungs and liver as indicated by hieroglyphic inscriptions The team found the balms contained a complex mix of ingredients including fats and oils beeswax bitumen resins from trees of the pine family a substance called coumarin that has a vanilla like scent and benzoic acid which can be found in many plant sources including cinnamon and cloves Many of the ingredients they note would have had to be imported to Egypt For instance certain resins like the larch tree resin likely came from the northern Mediterranean and central Europe said Huber One other substance was narrowed down to either a resin called dammar exclusive to south east Asian tropical forests or Pistacia tree resin In case it was dammar this would highlight the extensive trade networks of the Egyptians during the mid second millennium BCE bringing in ingredients from afar But not all of the ingredients identified were present in both of the jars a finding that might suggest the balms were organ specific although the team noted it could also be that they were originally the same but were poorly mixed or had degraded differently The researchers said few mummies had received the elaborated treatment Senetnay was given which with the non local provenance of many of the ingredients supported the view that she had a high social standing a situation already indicated by the site of her burial and her title Ornament of the King Huber added that working with a perfumer the team had recreated the balms scent which would be used in an exhibition at the Moesgaard Museum in Denmark this autumn The smell of the balm has been labelled the scent of the eternity Dr William Tullett an expert in sensory history at the University of York who was not involved in the work said recreating smells from history was crucial to understanding the relationship between the past and the present To our noses the warm resinous pine like odours of larch might be more reminiscent of cleaning products and the sulphurous scent of bitumen might put us in mind of asphalt But for Egyptians these smells clearly had a host of other meanings related to spirituality and social status he said It s those revealing comparisons between the here and now of smell that make recreations so interesting  Museum goers to be transported back to 1450BC by odours of oils resins and beeswax with which noblewoman Senetnay embalmed|16.0|24.0
88|Rishi Sunak excels in his summer job of making Tories look unelectable A pale watery sun crept through the window Autumn was nearly here About time thought Rishi Sunak The summer had been a total disaster He d tried to take charge of the media grid but had been rewarded with one bad headline after another He d have been better off doing nothing at all and giving himself and the country a break This last week had been no exception It had started with Nadine Dorries s resignation About time but he hadn t banked on an 1 800 word letter slagging him off in the Mail on Sunday She d even taken a pop at his shoes What was wrong with them Didn t everyone shop at Prada In hindsight he d badly misjudged the extent of her crush on Boris The woman was totally besotted Dazzled by his lies Then there was her entitlement Somehow expecting a peerage for being a crap MP and a worse culture secretary Maybe he should have just put her in the Lords and have done with it Just to get her off his back Then there had been Theresa May s deranged new book The Maybot seriously believed she had gone out of her way to try to deliver a Brexit that was acceptable to the 48 who had voted remain Er hello She had only insisted on a hard Brexit right from the off Had never even considered staying in the single market and the customs union Not that he cared He d always been in favour of a hard Brexit But that was beside the point Theresa was meant to represent the sensible side of the Tories Only it turned out she was just as delusional as the rest of them Making the party look out of touch and unelectable That was his job That had just been the start Then he d allowed himself to be talked into letting Suella Braverman do radio and TV interviews to kick off the totally pointless crime themed week He should have insisted the home secretary remain on holiday No one could make a bad situation worse quite like her It had been a total car crash First off she had insisted that from now on the police were going to investigate every crime thoroughly Even a stolen phone FFS What kind of idiot was she Reminding everyone that under the Tories the police scarcely got round to investigating murder and rape Especially when these crimes were committed by the police And it was just a joke to think the police were really going to spend hours on every burglary and car theft How was that going to work How many police did she think there were On second thoughts don t ask Suella had been under the impression that if you sack 20 000 officers and then recruit 23 000 more then you have 23 000 more than you had in the first place She d also totally forgotten that fraud counted as a crime There again so had he Best to ignore all those dodgy PPE contracts during the pandemic Still at least Suella had been a bit more clued up when asked about refugees on the Bibby Stockholm It was completely unrealistic for asylum seekers to expect their accommodation to pass health and safety requirements After all if they were prepared to cross the Channel in small boats they could hardly expect to live for ever Besides it was just the lefty unions making trouble What kind of person would want to become a firefighter anyway Putting yourself in harm s way to protect others That wasn t the Conservative way And the home secretary had been crystal clear about her desire to leave the ECHR Quite right What the country needed was strong leadership Like Russia and Belarus And that was about the end of crime week unless you counted the reannouncement of the reannouncement on zombie knives Even Rish knew that was scraping the barrel And the last few days had been just as much of a shambles A helicopter trip to Norwich to announce a relaxation in environmental rules for housebuilding Didn t people appreciate how difficult it had been to secure a flight slot from air traffic during the current chaos He had had to pull rank and remind everyone he also needed to drop in at Waitrose for the weekly

89|I ll never be able to achieve the perfect burpee or run a marathon so why do I suddenly love going to the gym  It s not the first time in my life that I ve had a gym membership but it is the first time that I have found myself wanting to go The gym is only about 50 metres from my house so I can t use distance as an excuse not to turn up It s a lovely space with pastel walls and big industrial windows The bathroom has free emergency supplies of tampons deodorant hair ties and sometimes even chocolate and there is always a pot of spiced cinnamon tea you can drink before you start your class Here I ve learned how to bench press deadlift and squat I ve giggled through dance routines I ve boxed out my anger and I ve discovered stomach muscles I never knew existed in pilates I surprise myself that I keep turning up but I do It s one of the few regular things in my life the only place I feel I must be It is my small routine and I cling to it Now I go four times a week sometimes five Early in the morning when the sky is still dark or late in the afternoon when I d prefer to be lying on the couch There are classes I particularly like because the instructors are young and funny and they have playlists full of music from artists like Stevie Wonder and Nile Rodgers that I listened to back when I was young and funny Most days I disappear into a sort of perimenopausal brain fog around when the instructor is explaining the exercises so invariably I must ask them to show me again how to do something And without my glasses I can t read the whiteboard that outlines what the class will involve so I just sort of bumble along I can never lift the heaviest weights pull off the lowest squat or even stretch expertly at the end but it s not that sort of place It s not competitive It s friendly and inclusive and I never feel like I don t belong I pull my greying hair into a ponytail wear old gym pants that have seen better days and a T shirt covered with paint stains and mostly manage to keep up I go with a friend who lives around the corner If it wasn t for her I m not sure that I would always respond positively to my alarm in the morning and get out of bed I might turn it off and go back to sleep But she keeps me accountable and that s a good thing My friend and I joke about the guns we re going to have one day which we both know will never happen It s enough to feel the slight rise of muscle on my upper arms and the ease of dashing up the stairs without my calves hurting Until now my body has mostly changed without my input It has changed through puberty and pregnancy through ageing and nature But due to the gym classes there are now little changes caused by my own will And with each of these changes I feel a connection to my body that I haven t felt in a long time When I was a teenager I played netball and tennis swam laps and ran for fun I kept playing netball into my adult life and only retired when each week one of my teammates would end up off the court with an injury and I was too scared that I d be next If anyone had asked me as a teenager why I loved playing sport I might have said because I liked the competition or being social or because I had a crush on someone on the team Now I know that exercise for me is not about any of those things although I do love the morning chats with my friend at the gym I think exercise is partly about leaving my thoughts behind I m no longer just a head on legs I m connected to muscles and joints I ll never be able to achieve the perfect burpee or run a marathon but I don t care I just want to stop thinking for an hour and move But the main reason I ve become a fan of lifting weights and jumping around is that now when my body hurts it s not just because of ageing but partly because I have caused it Because I have woken sleeping muscles with unfamiliar movements That is the joy for me That I now ache because of something that I did Not just because I m getting older Nova Weetman is an award winning author of books for children and young adults including The Edge of Thirteen the winner of the 2022 Abia award My body has mostly changed without my input Now it hurts because of something I did not just because I m getting older|22.0|16.0
90|You snooze you muse how to nap like a genius Toxic productivity culture that is the nagging sense that we should all be life hacking our way to health wealth and happiness comes with a host of well documented ill effects While many of us are justifiably knackered we are also haunted by an almost pathological fear of idleness Moira Junge CEO of the Australian Sleep Health Foundation thinks it is time we started to accept the toll modern life is taking on us That means catching our Zs when and where we can We talk a lot about sustainability but rarely about personal sustainability Junge says When it comes to getting enough rest she says I d love for people to be all tucked up in bed by 9pm but realistically there s so much standing in people s way Her advice Clean up your night time sleeping habits where possible But if you re consistently getting less than the recommended seven to nine hours shut eye a night it could be worth factoring in an afternoon nap to supplement that deficit This is hardly a novel concept The siesta has been a feature of societies around the world throughout history and to this day Great thinkers political heavyweights and finely tuned athletes from Einstein and Aristotle to JFK and LeBron James have all extolled the rejuvenating virtues of an afternoon kip It may even prevent your brain from shrinking We re born to nap According to Dr Michael Breus an American sleep expert and author our post lunch languor is all but inevitable He says humans are naturally biphasic sleepers meaning afternoon somnolence is hardwired into us An afternoon snooze or at least a spell of rest is practically a birthright He explains that along with a spike in melatonin production around 10 30pm to remind us to go to bed for the night we experience the same phenomenon during the day often between 1 and 3pm Succumbing to this innate call to calm according to a wealth of research can boost our mood cognitive function memory creative thinking and physical performance Timing is everything There are only two ways to avoid sleep inertia the unshakeable grogginess we feel when roused from deep sleep either take a short nap or a very long one Experts agree limiting a nap to 30 minutes or extending it to a full 90 minute sleep cycle is key Naps have been studied for decades As with all good science our knowledge of naps is ever evolving but there are a few tried and true techniques The caf nap short for caffeine nap Junge says a kip and an espresso can be a quick fix worked into a lunch break It involves downing a caffeinated beverage and closing your eyes with the intention of drifting off When the caffeine hits your brain about half an hour later it should act as a natural alarm This gives you 20 minutes of quality dozing but pulls you out before you slip into deep sleep While Junge points out many employers actively discourage sleeping on the job due to safety concerns she says if you re not working from home there s nothing wrong with sneaking off to your car or finding a sunny patch of grass The steel ball technique If you don t have a safe space or half an hour to spare but are struggling to keep your eyes open or tackle a tricky task take a leaf out of the nap book of Salvador Dali and Thomas Edison who embraced ultra short naps to boost creative thinking This method is sometimes known as the steel ball technique because it involves resting in a chair with a heavy object in your hand that will drop to the floor and startle you awake before you re too far gone It s widely held that hypnagogia that luscious semi lucid state we slip into just before we lose consciousness entirely is a wellspring of creativity A recent French study also indicates that being roused from this state can boost problem solving A full cycle If your overnight sleep has been particularly bad and you have time squeezing in a full 90 minutes of sleep could help put you back on the right side of the bed Some researchers believe it can even be counted towards your 24 hour sleep total Junge says while some doctors will tell people who have trouble sleeping at night to avoid naps in some cases napping can paradoxically help sort out disrupted circadian rhythms Good sleep begets good sleep she says While it s well known we can t repay a sleep debt accrued from a busy week by lying in on the weekend working towards getting the recommended seven to nine hours during each 24 hour day can help limit the damage Cause for alarm Sutapa Mukherjee president of the Australasian Sleep Association says if you are getting seven to nine hours of quality sleep overnight you may still experience a post lunch slump but the urge to completely crash out should be limited However she says most people drastically overestimate the amount of sleep they are getting If you find yourself able to fall asleep and don t wake of your own accord after one full sleep cycle of 90 minutes during the day or regularly doze off while trying to fulfil your obligations it s likely you are seriously sleep deprived or may even be suffering from an acute condition such as sleep apnea narcolepsy or hypersomnolence The key thing is how are you feeling during the day Do you feel refreshed when you wake up and can you stay alert for your waking hours If not you re probably not getting enough sleep As you drift off Much like eating enough fruits and vegetables Junge says getting enough sleep can be challenging but it should always be something to aspire to The physical and mental health benefits are just enormous She adds that napping refreshes the mind and body helps us remain more engaged and also makes us less likely to reach for unhealthy foods and stimulants during the draining second shift of our day Because naps have been shown to help us regulate our emotions this can benefit not just us but those around us While Mukherjee would prefer we prioritise our overnight sleep she concedes circumstances may not always allow it I think people should nap if they haven t got enough sleep and most people probably aren t  Backed by science and endorsed by luminaries the daytime nap has many benefits Good timing means the difference between inspiration energy or full sleep inertia|11.0|22.0

92|Alisha Aitken Radburn on The Bachelor s villain edit I thought I d decimated my political prospects  At first Alisha Aitken Radburn was excited to see herself as a contestant on Australia s The Bachelor But by the season s midway point it was clear she wasn t getting the edit she d hoped for Along with two of her friends in the cast Aitken Radburn was being painted as a mean girl In the scheme of reality television villains her behaviour was not particularly egregious a rude remark here a heated argument there But the 2018 season she was featured on with former rugby union player Nick The Honey Badger Cummins reached a mammoth average national audience of 1 25 million many of which turned against her As each episode aired her social media was flooded with comments and messages calling her a dog a turd a bully and a putrid rat It was relentless and felt she recalls like an existential crisis I had a picture of who I was as a person in my mind Aitken Radburn says I didn t think that I was an angel but I didn t think that I was the absolutely horrible person that people in my Instagram DMs were telling me that I was Five years on from that public flaying Aitken Radburn is reflecting on reality TV in a new memoir The Villain Edit named for the portrayal she received on that juggernaut franchise A former political staffer Aitken Radburn is warm in our interview but has a politician s knack for answering the question she wanted to be asked rather than the one she was asked Her book doesn t present her as a hapless victim she admits to her own mistakes on set and ruthlessly examines the aspects of her personality that drew her to the genre in the first place and saw her return for two seasons of the spin off show Bachelor in Paradise It s a nuanced look at what goes on behind the scenes of reality television one which balances the good with the bad Sign up for the fun stuff with our rundown of must reads pop culture and tips for the weekend every Saturday morning Other former reality TV contestants have spoken out against the way they were manoeuvred by producers but the manipulation was soft for Aitken Radburn I can identify the levers that were being pulled During filming she had realised she wasn t being considered a real romantic option for Cummins she spoke to him for a grand total of 15 minutes during her six weeks on the show she says That s why to try and buy myself more episodes she offered up quips about castmates and their appearances in her confessional interviews I wanted to do a good job for the producer I d say something spicy and I would get a laugh from the producer And that laugh was just kryptonite to me Initially those remarks made her the season s funny narrator But the line between funny narrator and villain is easy to trip over It wasn t all the edit There were definitely things that we said in interviews that we thought were edgy and funny And they just weren t they were mean Aitken Radburn s reality TV stint was complicated by her career She was 25 and working as an advancer for the Labor party in then opposition leader Bill Shorten s office when reeling from a bad breakup she applied for The Bachelor on an impulse Higher ups considered the dating show a liability political staffers are expected to stay behind the scenes and she was forced to resign One colleague expressed that basically I would live to regret it Aitken Radburn says Upon her return to Canberra now jobless but catching up with former workmates over drinks an unnamed female Labor MP told her she had degraded herself and should be embarrassed I thought I d completely decimated my prospects of being considered a savvy smart political operator again she says The Villain Edit is also the story of Aitken Radburn s lifelong feelings of inadequacy which she writes about with admirable honesty In the past it has led her to seeking validation through sexual relationships pursuing uninterested men and going to great lengths to make her life seem perfect on Instagram That need for validation manifested in how she handled the aftermath of the show too She opted not to switch off her Instagram comments despite the abuse and would trawl Bachelor fan forums to find out what others thought of her She even went on a date with one of the trolls in her DMs she sent a flirtatious reply to his admonishment two weeks later they were making out outside a brewery And she writes about feeling envious of friend and castmate Brooke Blurton who swiftly acquired the sort of post Bachelor media career Aitken Radburn had wanted for herself I can be a deeply insecure person she says I don t think that that s something that people express very often Aitken Radburn eventually found a new role in politics working for a number of years as the director of events and fundraising for NSW Labor She juggled her political career with a further two seasons of Bachelor in Paradise different people within the party have different appetites for risk she says and fared much better on the spin off scoring a flattering redemption arc She also met her husband on the show Glenn Smith the pair becoming one of the rare couples to actually find love on reality TV Today they live in Perth where Aitken Radburn now 30 works in government relations at a community services organisation with a side hustle as an Instagram influencer So on balance was her former colleague right did she live to regret her decision to go on reality TV I definitely don t Aitken Radburn says I look at where I ve landed and I wouldn t want to be anywhere else The Villain Edit by Alisha Aitken Radburn is out now through Allen and Unwin Aitken Radburn s spicy remarks were an attempt to win more airtime on Australia s 2018 season But then the DMs started rolling in |7.0|7.0
93|Fresh faces and record trades set up exciting AFLW season of surprises Last year brought two AFLW seasons thanks to the league s shift from summer to late August and it has made the wait for Friday night s 2023 season opener feel that much longer While there was no main draft this off season given the intake between the last two seasons there s still been plenty of change A tumultuous trade period gave way to a mature age supplementary draft in April before the players settled in for pre season at the end of May It means there are a lot of unknowns St Kilda were perhaps the most proactive over the off season picking up the league s leading goalkicker Jesse Wardlaw from Brisbane along with Collingwood s former captain Steph Chiocci and midfielder Jaimee Lambert It will amp up the pressure on Nick Dal Santo s team to take their performance to the next level never having won more than three matches in a season Greater Western Sydney will also look very different after being hampered by serious injuries last season Giants fans will welcome the return of former Bulldog and rising star Izzy Huntington who spent last season recovering from an ACL rupture with cult hero Pepa Randall knee and Chloe Dalton hamstring also returning to action It wouldn t be an AFLW season without rule changes the most noticeable this season being an interchange cap of 60 rotations with clubs to use boards to communicate rotations and tactics as in the men s competition While it was initially speculated the rotation cap would hurt newer sides with fewer pre seasons under their belt top teams like Brisbane have honed tactical use of their bench and could also be disadvantaged Despite generous trade and draft provisions to rolling waves of expansion sides three foundation teams have dominated AFLW since its inception Adelaide Brisbane and last season s premiers Melbourne have claimed five of the six premiership cups so far Brisbane have suffered losses at the trade table over expansion periods having previously weathered the storm with their depth of talent the Lions should still challenge this season The recent Women s World Cup was the first to expand the number of qualifying teams from 16 to 32 which some feared would result in extremely unbalanced score lines Instead football fans saw an evening of the playing field thanks to break out performances from relative minnows The AFLW will hope for a similar result in its second year of complete expansion and the fact that about 10 of players moved in the most recent trade period suggests players may begin to balance the league out North Melbourne the other season seven preliminary finalist presents a scary prospect for opponents They have had significant player movement in the off season but have managed to keep their core intact That familiarity will bring a big advantage in this turbulent time Former Saints forward Kate Shierlaw and draftee Ruby Tripodi who will make her AFLW debut this weekend should excite though the balance of the Roos forward line may skew tall When it comes to potential best and fairest winners it s hard to go past household names like Richmond s Monique Conti and North Melbourne s Jasmine Garner But considering the young talent lining up this season is a more interesting task These players are enjoying more opportunities to hone their craft which along with the 10 game fixture giving some teams easier runs may help to level the playing field across the league The AFLW captains have named Hawthorn s Jasmine Fleming Gold Coast s Alana Gee and Port Adelaide s Matilda Scholz as their favourites for rising star Another player to watch is Essendon s first ever draft pick Amber Clarke who has settled well into top flight football The season opener has morphed over the years but has retained a certain excitementsince the inaugural match between Carlton and Collingwood at IKON Park in 2017 resulted in a lockout with a crowd of 25 000 There will be added anticipation on Friday evening to see last year s winners Melbourne who will unfurl their premiership flag The Dees only loss from their premiership team was captain Daisy Pearce to retirement and they re now ably led by forward Kate Hore It will be a big early test for Collingwood who lost star Chloe Molloy to Sydney but will regain Brit Bonnici and captain Brianna Davey from serious knee injuries The South Australian Showdown between Adelaide and Port Adelaide at Norwood Oval on Saturday afternoon is sure to be a heated clash Adelaide a foundation AFLW team made the preliminary final last year and have a strong midfield but have also had to adjust their forward line The Power s effort to raid the Crows highlighted by captain Erin Phillips move to the club where her father Greg played continued this off season after they swiped key forward Ash Saint nee Woodland Port s recruits will complement their earlier draft hand with rising star winner Hannah Ewings and Abbey Dowrick among the players to have instantly shown promise With just one win and a draw in their first season the team s performance belied their talent but there is growth in their list and time together can only help This game could represent the beginning of a changing of the guard sounding a warning to the competition and perhaps reflecting the surprises in store this AFLW season  Second year of all 18 teams could see levelling of the playing field and end dominance of Adelaide Melbourne and Brisbane|14.0|14.0

95|Queensland may face damages bill for unlawful detention of children in watch houses lawyers say The Queensland government could still face a damages bill in the tens of millions of dollars some lawyers say despite retrospective legislation exempting it from liability for holding children in adult police watch houses Dylan Voller s lawyer Peter O Brien the solicitor behind the class action against the Northern Territory s Don Dale youth detention centre said he believed the retrospective legislation could be challenged in court He estimated the state government would probably owe children unlawfully held in police watch houses as much as 5 000 for each day behind bars plus damages If the circumstances of the detention were particularly decrepit or unpleasant or cruel or inhumane then that would go to aggravated damages he said And then in addition to that there would be damages of a punitive nature exemplary damages Those would be damages which would ordinarily apply in the case where an authority exercising legislative power fails to do so lawfully Sign up for Guardian Australia s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Children could also claim for other damages including a residual liberty claim for the worse conditions of a police watch house compared with a youth detention centre O Brien said He said all told an ordinary child could claim for tens of thousands each The practice of detaining children in police watch houses has been used for decades in Queensland with thousands of children a year in 2021 and 2022 kept for longer than six hours and hundreds for longer than 48 hours according to data released in parliament At 5 000 per night spent this could work out to 35m alone for these two years The state government last week passed amendments retroactively legalising the practice after the supreme court ordered the release of three children from police custody earlier this month The government later received advice from the solicitor general that said its interpretation of the Youth Justice Act was likely incorrect potentially meaning children collectively had spent thousands of days unlawfully imprisoned Guardian Australia spoke to other lawyers who doubted the success of any challenge pointing to the case of the Ukrainian Australian man Ivan Polyukhovich a soldier of the second world war convicted of war crimes in the 1990s on the basis of retrospective legislation Other laws that retroactively prohibited tax arrangements or redefined the meaning of corrupt conduct have survived legal challenge though others have failed In 2013 the high court overturned retrospective laws requiring reporting income and assets to Centrelink The Australian Lawyers Alliance head Greg Barnes said retrospective legislation could be challenged The view is that if legislation is retrospective and that retrospectively adversely impacts on a right that a person may have had for example to sue for false imprisonment then unless the words are absolutely clear and capable of no other interpretation a court may rule in favour of the person who s seeking to enforce a right he said Retrospective legislation is seemed to be generally offending the rule of law O Brien said it was an extraordinary and rare step for any government to take I think that that sort of legislation that renders lawful what would otherwise have been unlawful in relation to liberty of children is imminently challengeable he said In my view it s totally irresponsible and also potentially discriminatory depending on how it impacts on certain children more than others Queensland s youth justice minister Di Farmer said the government needed to enact the amendments to address a technical error in orders being made for young people going into detention which was highlighted in recent supreme court proceedings We will continue to ensure young people ordered into custody by a court spend the least amount of time possible in watch houses she said The government sought and acted on the advice of the solicitor general to ensure 30 years of established practice and process could continue in the best interests and safety of the community young people in custody staff and visitors to detention centres The state is under increased pressure to release the solicitor general s legal advice Some Labor MPs who have become increasingly restless over the issue say privately they are concerned the legal advice was being used to justify what amounted to a policy decision Once the solicitor general found watch houses were unlawful we had two decisions comply with the law or change the law an MP said That s a matter of policy They say it s not possible but I m not convinced we ve tried hard enough Genevieve Sinclair the chief executive of Yeti said it was critical to know what advice the government relied upon when it decided to override the Human Rights Act with no consultation It has to be released she said MPs who spoke to Guardian Australia say they were angry to discover the existence of a letter from Yeti that appeared to cast doubt about some of the government s claims it had to act with urgency The letter shows the organisation flagged it might take further legal action without notice but that it also offered to work with government on transitional arrangements that would avoid the sort of test case that would result in large numbers of children being transferred into youth detention where there is no current capacity Guardian Australia asked the acting premier Steven Miles whether he was aware of that letter and held the same concerns His office said he has answered a lot of questions at media conferences on this and referred to comments by Farmer that the solicitor general had provided specific advice related to the letter Asked on Thursday whether the letter shows the government had an alternative to legislating the transport minister Mark Bailey referred to the legal advice Well the government needs to take advice on these matters The solicitor general is obviously a key person to give that advice I understand that advice was provided  Dylan Voller s

96|Judge who falsely imprisoned man during property settlement faces second claim of wrongly jailing man Lawyers for a second man who alleges he was falsely imprisoned by judge Salvatore Vasta say they will press forward with their case in the wake of a damning judgment denying him judicial immunity on Wednesday The federal court on Wednesday found in favour of a man known only as Mr Stradford who alleged he was falsely imprisoned by Vasta during a routine property settlement dispute in 2018 Vasta believing the man was withholding financial details jailed him for contempt The federal court described the inferior court judge s actions as a gross and obvious irregularity of procedure saying he committed serious and fundamental errors exceeded his jurisdiction and was not entitled to the protection of judicial immunity A second case against Vasta launched by Queensland man Leigh Jorgensen has been temporarily on hold pending Wednesday s judgment His lawyers Ken Cush and Associates say they will now proceed in suing Vasta personally for alleged false imprisonment Jorgensen a Queensland tourism operator was before Vasta on a minor civil matter relating to alleged underpayments in 2018 Believing he had breached freezing orders Vasta found Jorgensen guilty of contempt of court and sentenced him to 12 months imprisonment though he was to be released after 10 days if he paid money to the Fair Work Ombudsman Sign up for Guardian Australia s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup The full bench of the federal court intervened after the man had spent two days behind bars It found Vasta s trial of the man for contempt of court had substantially miscarried for at least four reasons including the primary judge s excessive unwarranted and inappropriate interventions The court described Vasta s behaviour in the Jorgensen case as an egregious departure from the role of a judge presiding over an adversarial trial The departure had meant his ability to objectively evaluate the evidence was fundamentally compromised The court described his approach as sarcastic disparaging and dismissive of significant parts of Mr Jorgensen s evidence and said his questioning was aggressive and at times unfair Jorgensen sued Vasta personally in early 2021 but his case was temporarily stayed or put on hold pending the outcome in the Stradford case His case also alleges Vasta should not be afforded the usual judicial immunity that protects judges from being sued because he acted without jurisdiction or exceeded his jurisdiction His claim against Vasta alleges an abuse of government power and a disregard for Jorgensen s rights It also alleges Jorgensen suffered mental harm and humiliation due to the imprisonment Ken Cush and Associates which represents both Jorgensen and Stradford confirmed it would now push ahead with Jorgensen s claim In light of this decision we anticipate another matter already before the federal court the matter of Jorgensen will be relisted for case management in coming weeks Sam Tierney the firm s principal solicitor said The Australian Bar Association meanwhile has said the Stradford decision should prompt urgent consideration of legislative reform The association s president Peter Dunning KC said the decision raised potentially significant issues for the work of judges in inferior courts Without in any way commenting on the content of the judgment itself or diminishing the impact of the events on the applicant the issue raised concerning judicial immunity is one of such magnitude that it should be the subject of urgent legislative consideration regardless of whether the judgment is appealed Dunning said Judicial immunity is an important institutional requirement in facilitating the fearless administration of justice by judges across Australia When occasions arise such as the present that in a significant way impact the understanding of its boundaries it is always appropriate to consider whether the immunity remains appropriately calibrated to securing that fearless independence It is unclear who will pay for Vasta s legal costs or for any damages but commonwealth officials such as judges are generally insured by Comcover the Australian government s self managed insurance fund A spokesperson for the attorney general Mark Dreyfus said the government was considering the judgment delivered yesterday in this matter but declined to comment further The government continues to consult with the legal sector about the prospect of a federal judicial commission which could investigate complaints against judges It has provided in principle support to establishing the commission In June Dreyfus told more than 80 federal circuit and family court of Australia judges that any model for a commission must respect the independence of the courts and judiciary enshrined in the constitution as this independence is fundamental to the rule of law and democracy in Australia A spokesperson for the federal circuit and family court said the court and Vasta would not comment  Lawyers to push forward with action against Salvatore Vasta after federal court found he committed serious and

97|Consultancy firm used power maps of Australian officials to help win government contracts A consultancy firm that secured 528m of taxpayer money last year has admitted to maintaining hundreds of power maps that categorise federal officials based on influence personality type and relationships with competitors Accenture has told the Senate the maps are restricted and only supplied to staff on a need to know basis but acknowledged they were used in the process of bidding for government work The power maps detail whether officials are analytical expressive or a driver They identify key decision makers and who has the most influence within teams and rank how favourably officials may view Accenture The power maps also monitor internal conflicts within departments and any negative relationships between colleagues They monitor which public servants may have relationships with rival consultancy firms and how strong those connections are Accenture s market lead for Australia and New Zealand Peter Burns detailed the power maps to a parliamentary inquiry into consultants This was in a response to questions from Labor senator Deborah O Neill who is a member of the committee conducting the inquiry Within Accenture access to power maps is restricted and can only be accessed by individuals on a need to know basis Burns said in documents published by the Senate Power maps are used as part of a tendering process to determine how we may assist a client to effect change within their organisation particularly in relation to understanding the outcomes the client is seeking to achieve and ensuring we can provide appropriate solutions Sign up for Guardian Australia s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup But O Neill told Guardian Australia that the practice of power mapping departmental officials represents an overt attempt by consulting companies to inappropriately influence the public service Accenture is not considered one of the big four consultancy firms but is favoured by the federal government Last financial year its contracts with the public service were worth 528m which is more than that of KPMG Deloitte and PwC and double what EY was paid The big four firms told the Senate inquiry that they did not engage in any form of power mapping although those assurances will be scrutinised at upcoming inquiry hearings PwC Australia does not engage in the practice of power mapping or maintain records that characterise public servants by influence relationships to one another or attitude towards consultancies said Jan McCahey PwC s chief risk and ethics leader O Neill told Guardian Australia she would seek more information and push for fulsome and honest responses to the questions which I have put to these firms Accenture was unable to say how many power maps had been maintained but estimated hundreds have been created in relation to government opportunities from 2015 onwards Whenever we participate in a tendering process we strictly abide by the probity rules which includes not contacting or participating in any discussions or meetings with any individuals including any that may be included on a power map who are part of the decision making process for that tender Burns told the inquiry Power maps are one element in our assessment of potential client projects and are used on most of our client engagements including with our public service clients and as part of our account planning processes During a Senate inquiry hearing in July Burns said Accenture had not changed its internal processes as a result of the reputation crisis that engulfed PwC Australia and led to its government services division being divested for just 1 I would be misleading the committee if we said we specifically did something different as a consequence of the PwC scandal Burns told the inquiry  Accenture s Peter Burns tells Senate the documents identifying key decision makers and influence leaders have been used to tender for work|3.0|10.0
98|Study discipline and a lot of hard yakka Rinky Hijikata s recipe for tennis success As an insight into the competitiveness of Rinky Hijikata the fretful hours following his thrilling debut performance on Arthur Ashe Stadium in New York last August are illuminating Pitted against four time champion Rafael Nadal the Australian started with an audacity that astounded the 24 000 fans expecting to see a legend waltz to a win against a wildcard The 22 time major winner ultimately gained the upper hand but as Hijikata contemplated the defeat over a pizza later that night he was far from satisfied It had been an experience to savour given his inexperience But this did not temper his regret Hijikata felt he had let the Spanish legend off the hook Looking back at it there are things I think I could have done a little bit better he said That is easy to say in hindsight but I think maybe I took my foot off the gas a little bit Hijikata who will make his first appearance in a third round at a grand slam against China s Zhizen Zhang on Friday tries to learn a lesson from every experience The losses he endured in his maiden season in 2022 have helped him strengthen his game and regardless of how he fares against Zhang who upset 2022 US Open finalist Casper Ruud on Wednesday the 22 year old will break into the top 100 for the first time in his career The computer does not lie for his relentless quality when thrashing 2021 Wimbledon quarter finalist Marton Fucsovics 6 1 6 2 6 1 on Wednesday was the mark of a top tier talent The right hander stands 1 78m which is short by tour standards But his legs have the thickness of tree trunks and were developed courtesy of a lot of hard yakka Hijikata attributes this to a killer summer in the gym at the end of last year when he realised he needed extra strength to thrive and take a step forward in his fledgling career The benefits were immediate Hijikata won his first grand slam match in Melbourne and partnered Jason Kubler to win the Australian Open doubles crown The swiftness of his court coverage was a feature against Fucsovics at Flushing Meadows Be it zipping between the corners or sneaking forward for an attack at the net his speed surprised his rival There were some dark times when you are in the gym and getting flogged but when you get through matches like these it makes it all worthwhile he said The importance of lessons was drummed into him as a boy growing up in Sydney His father Makoto who hails from Tokyo is a tennis coach His mother Junko is from Kobe The 22 year old speaks with a broad Australian accent and has Davis Cup aspirations But prior to this year s Australian Open he said he had great respect for his family s heritage Japan is almost like a second home to me I love the culture I love the food and everything And I can kind of speak the language he said Hijikata was promising enough to travel to junior grand slams as a teenager But tennis is littered with junior stars who failed to make the transition to professional ranks His mother always stressed the importance of education and having a profession to fall back on which precipitated a move to the University of North Carolina in 2019 Hijikata has no doubt the two years he spent studying a business degree at Chapel Hill where he earned All American honours while on a tennis scholarship helped make him A network of friends boosted his confidence And the discipline required to juggle studying with the training and playing demands of a collegiate player helped him mature My goal was always to become a professional tennis player he said Ever since I was really young that s all I ever wanted I never really saw myself doing anything else to be honest But for a little while there I struggled with injuries and whatnot and college kind of became the clear path for me Shortly after his opening round win on Monday he learned a UNC faculty member had been killed in a shooting that sent Chapel Hill into a lockdown lasting several hours Hijikata was there last week preparing for the US Open and his girlfriend and several close friends still attend the university The news rocked him But it also motivated him In his match on Court 7 on Wednesday alma mater from the Tar Heels were urging Hijikata on as enthusiastically as those wearing the green and gold and waving Southern Cross flags Chapel Hill was his undergraduate college but a finishing school in Sydney helped round the rough edges off Hijikata as he embarked on his professional dream All the New South Wales players have always looked after me when I am in Sydney and inspired me to get better he said The De Minaurs The Thompsons Chris O Connell Aleks Vukic The Duck James Duckworth Max Purcell All these guys We all push each other to get better The youngest member is through to a third round in New York Alex de Minaur who is the leader of the pack and O Connell will bid to join him on Thursday in New York  The Australian wildcard has reached the US Open third round and is set to break into the top 100 for the first time|14.0|14.0
99|Coalition no campaigners spending four times more on voice Facebook ads than counterparts Coalition politicians who oppose the Indigenous voice to parliament are vastly outspending other parliamentarians on Facebook and in some cases using taxpayer funded expenses to boost ads that personally target yes campaigners and raise doubt about the reliability of the voting process According to a Guardian Australia analysis of federal politicians advertising data in Meta s ad library Coalition politicians have spent over four times more on Facebook ads about the voice than Labor politicians Among the top 10 Facebook accounts belonging to politicians that shared ads supporting a yes or no vote the majority were from the Coalition The top five between 1 August 2022 to 21 August 2023 were Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price who leads the official no campaign Fair Australia alongside Coalition members of parliament Keith Pitt Rick Wilson Jason Wood and Senator Michaelia Cash all of whom are advocating a no vote Labor MP Dr Michelle Ananda Rajah and independent MP Zali Steggall were the only two from the top 10 who shared messages in support of the voice or promoted pro voice community forums Politicians are given an annual office expenses budget that they can use for advertising on social media platforms They re not required to sit on the sidelines said Peter Chen a senior lecturer at the University of Sydney who researches media and politics Just like we saw with the same sex postal survey there s a reason for politicians to attach their brands to various sides Sign up for Guardian Australia s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup Coalition MP Rick Wilson was one of several politicians among the top 10 who told Guardian Australia the advertising blitz had been paid for by the annual capped budget for office expenses As the member for a 1 1 million square kilometre electorate I have a responsibility to inform all those communities he said Social media is a very effective way to inform those many and diverse regional and remote communities Facebook s ad library only provides the upper and lower range of ad spend but politicians sharing content against the voice may have spent up to 175 341 while those in support spent up to 37 163 Overall the official yes campaign vehicle Yes23 remains the biggest spender on Facebook ads on the referendum followed by the Australian government which is running a neutral multi language education campaign about the voice called Be ready for the conversation The no campaign accounts Advance Australia and Fair Australia as well as the Australian Electoral Commission round out the top five Some Australian politicians are paying to make their personal case for why Australians should vote yes or no Top 10 spender Ananda Rajah has paid to boost videos in Victoria and across Australia in which she explains the voice and makes the case for why First Nations people get special privileges in the constitution when other minorities don t Steggal paid almost 4 000 for ads promoting a community event with the director of Yes23 Dean Parkin as well as a webinar about the referendum Queensland MP Phillip Thompson also in the top 10 paid up to 2 000 for posts that detail why he and his wife who is Indigenous will vote no Race based constitutional change puts one person in our marriage above the other which goes against our entire belief system his ad states Coalition boosting ads that target voice campaigners Some Coalition accounts have also paid to boost content on Facebook that personally targets campaigners for the voice including an attack ad about Thomas Mayo Mayo is on the government s referendum working group and is one of the more prominent public advocates for the voice The clip created by Advance Australia splices together several of Mayo s public addresses about the voice set to ominous music Victorian Liberal MP Jason Wood spent up to 598 boosting the video on both Instagram and Facebook according to Meta s ad library tool Western Australian MP Andrew Hastie spent up to 499 while Queenslanders Garth Hamilton up to 299 Andrew Willcox up to 199 and Phil Thompson up to 2 000 also put money behind the ad The singling out of Mayo has prompted a sharp rebuke from figures including Liberal MP Julian Leeser In a speech in Wagga Wagga in July Leeser was critical of the no campaign s attempt to target a small number of high profile Aboriginal people The spliced videos of the no case using Thomas Mayo s words are meant to get you angry and get you voting against a person even though this person is not on the ballot paper he said Lawyer and Wiradjuri and Wailwan woman Teela Reid has also been the subject of paid ads from Andrew Willcox and Jason Wood the latter of which paid up to 499 to promote an Advance Australia video about Reid on Facebook Another one of Albanese s handpicked voice advisory members and she s got a lot to say Wood s ad reads The Advance Australia video features clips of Reid discussing reparations and the voice and like the Mayo clip is similarly spliced together with sinister music in the background Raising doubt about the voice and voting process Some politicians in the top 10 spenders have run ads that could mislead about the scope of the voice Henry Pike for example has run an ad across Australia that implying the voice may cancel Australia Day Likewise an ad shared by Jason Wood states Aukus at risk under Labor s voice referring to the trilateral security pact The voice will have no ability to abolish public holidays or veto defence policy Coalition politicians have also been criticised for sharing content that raises doubt about the process of the referendum vote Michaelia Cash and Wood have collectively spent up to 700 so far on ads about whether crosses on the referendum ballot paper will count as a no vote If ticks count for yes then crosses should count for no otherwise it gives the yes case an unfair advantage the ad shared by Cash read The discussion stems from a recent Sky News interview with the electoral commissioner Tom Rogers who emphasised that voters should only write yes or no on the ballot But he also acknowledged well established rules called savings provisions that allow the Australian Electoral Commission AEC to count votes that don t strictly follow such instructions These might include a tick as yes but would not include a cross as no This distinction was seized upon as another attempt to stack the deck by the no campaign but was smacked down by the AEC In a statement last week the commission said much of the commentary was factually incorrect The AEC completely and utterly rejects the suggestions by some that by transparently following the established public and known legislative requirements we are undermining the impartiality and fairness of the referendum it said Chen said it was worrisome that the AEC has had to weigh in on the opposition s statements They border on American style election paranoia which has been very toxic he said of the claims Senator Cash said in a statement We should not have a rule that risks counting votes for the yes side but ignoring them for the no case The sensible thing would be to make a simple rule so that ticks and crosses are treated equally and neither side gets an advantage The AEC s formal voting instructions for the referendum are to clearly write either yes or no in full in English All politicians named in the story were approached for comment Price Wood Thompson Pike Hastie and Hamilton did not respond by publication Willcox and Antic declined to comment Notes A database of ads from 1 August 2022 to 22 August 2023 was compiled by searching the Facebook political ad database via API Ads were classified as related to the voice to parliament using a mix of machine learning classification keywords and advertiser identifiers You can read about the methods in more detail here An ad was considered yes or no if it advocated for a particular side mentioned only one side or the benefits of voting yes or no or promoted an event with only campaigners from one side of the campaign Neutral ads mostly includes posts promoted by government organisations such as the AEC media promoting news stories and people or organisations promoting information events which did not appear to take a side based on the content of the ad Facebook accounts were then classified by side based on this data where an account had any instance of yes leaning ads they were classified as yes no ads as no and if they were entirely neutral they were classified as neutral Exclusive Coalition MPs who oppose the voice to parliament have spent thousands in taxpayer funded expenses to boost no campaign ads|2.0|10.0
100|Foul fumes and sewage spills in Tory stronghold of Michael Gove While Michael Gove was deciding to weaken pollution laws for new housing developments this week his own constituency was being plagued by the stench of human waste People living on the outskirts of Camberley the largest town in Gove s constituency of Surrey Heath have been complaining for months that foul smelling fumes from the local sewage works have ruined their summers causing even the washing they hang out to stink There were mixed opinions of Gove in the house proud suburbs of the town where generous front gardens feature painstakingly tended flowerbeds He s a prat quite frankly declared 63 year old Brian Jackson who described himself as a Conservative He s two faced and spouts a load of hot air Increasing the pollution and destroying the environment won t go down very well down here If housebuilders can get away with polluting they will You need development and houses for people to live but it needs to be done in the right way He said the deregulation was not the fault of Brexit which he had voted for It isn t to do with Brexit it s to do with Michael Gove and the choices he is making Jackson said He said that as he had a poor sense of smell following a Covid infection he had not been affected by the local sewage stench but added But my wife has smelled it she said it s awful John Anderson a full time carer for his mother said he did not generally get involved in politics but cared deeply about sewage spills in the local area The town had a particularly bad spill in 2012 when Thames Water illegally discharged raw effluent into the river killing hundreds of fish The company was fined 220 000 for permit breaches Anderson said There s a sewage outflow on the other side of the valley there there s a whirlpool area where something s getting streamed out in to that 24 hours a day seven days a week which I don t particularly agree with at all You know basically when it comes to rivers clean them up don t muck them up Anderson added that he did not agree with the idea of removing pollution rules to encourage housebuilding Housing I understand is obviously a problem but it has to be done sensibly We need to leave nature alone Because we don t have much of it left Joanne Eves a teaching assistant had voted Conservative in the past but said she had never been a great fan of Gove I don t have a terribly high opinion of him anyway I know we need houses but they don t seem to actually care about the environment as well which also needs protecting She said she had been affected throughout the summer from the sewage stench depending on which way the wind blows Eves said she was unsurprised that the promise of tougher environmental laws after Brexit had not materialised They said they d do lots of things after Brexit I didn t vote for Brexit and wanted to stay None of the stuff they said would come after Brexit really has come after Brexit and I m not really surprised Despite Gove s majority of more than 18 000 votes in a constituency that has been solidly Tory since its creation in 1997 she thinks the levelling up secretary could be ousted at the next election I think it could easily go to Liberal Democrats If you d asked me maybe even two years ago I would have said no we ll stay Conservative But now I m not so sure Alasdair Pinkerton the Liberal Democrat parliamentary candidate for the constituency thinks Gove has underestimated the strength of local feeling about pollution and the environment Speaking of the sewage stench in the area he said It s quite extraordinary that this has happened but in a way it speaks to poor regulation in this area I think when people start to hear and understand that further deregulation of environmental protections is now being considered by the government I think people will be pretty horrified He said residents would be particularly aggrieved that Gove was ripping up development standards for homes A campaign in the Camberley area recently stopped a park and recreation area being turned into flats he said Pinkerton explained The people of Surrey Heath are acutely aware that our green spaces get chewed up and get turned into sometimes very poor developments I mean I wouldn t say that the people here are nimbys in any way but they are anti bad development and they ve seen a lot of bad development over recent times that has not been done in harmony with the environment that has led to for example local flooding that hasn t come with the associated services One fan of Gove was happy to speak up however Millie 75 would only give her first name but said she had been a fan of the MP since he presented a certificate to her child some decades ago I ve seen him around ever since and he s been to the church she explained adding that although the local sewage smell was quite bad at times Gove had tried to fix it He s been over there and he s met with Thames Water and written letters and he s very active on Facebook about it she said  Aggrieved residents tell of issues in constituency of housing secretary planning to rip up pollution laws|16.0|3.0

102|Mountain view Bank top economist offers two routes to beating inflation Tourist attraction backdrop to millions of selfies and one of the world s most easily identifiable landmarks Cape Town s Table Mountain is all of these things but now it has found a new role as a guide to what will happen to UK interest rates For Huw Pill the opportunity was too good to pass up Invited by South Africa s central bank to speak at a high level conference the Bank of England s chief economist said there were two ways for Threadneedle Street to bring UK inflation back to the government s 2 target One was the Matterhorn model named after the jagged 4 478 metre high peak in the Alps under which interest rates would go up sharply and come down sharply Alternatively the Bank could go down the Table Mountain route This approach would involve a lower peak the mountain rises to 1 085 metres but then stay at a high altitude for a considerable period The flat plateau above Cape Town is approximately 1 9 miles 3km from side to side Pill said his preference was for Table Mountain over the Matterhorn The Bank s prime task he explained was to see the job through on inflation But its nine strong monetary policy committee MPC was mindful of the fact that 14 interest rate rises since December 2021 were starting to hurt and it was aware of the risk of causing needless pain There may be multiple paths that get you to where you want to be Pill said in his speech Some of them have rates rising rapidly and falling rapidly in what is sometimes known as the Matterhorn profile The alternative would be to hold restriction for longer in a more steady and resolute way with a profile for interest rates that looks more like the Table Mountain I would tend to favour the latter Pill s comments suggest he will be voting for official borrowing costs to be raised again from 5 25 to 5 5 when the MPC meets later in September but then may well opt for them to stay on a plateau for some time to come While the headline inflation rate has fallen from a peak of 11 1 in October 2022 to 6 8 in July Pill said core inflation a measure of the cost of living that excludes items such as food and energy remained stubbornly high and was yet to show an obvious downward trend The key element is that we on the MPC need to see the job through and ensure a lasting and sustainable return of inflation to the 2 target he said At present the emphasis is still on ensuring that we are in the words of the MPC s last statement sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to ensure that we have that lasting return to target Meanwhile the latest data from the eurozone showed inflation was higher than expected in August at 5 3 unchanged from July Economists polled by Reuters had expected it to fall to 5 1 Pill acknowledged the risk of pushing UK rates too high Now that policy is in restrictive territory there is the possibility of doing too much and inflicting unnecessary damage on employment and growth he said But he said there was no room for complacency and that the Bank needed to see a lasting and sustainable reduction in inflation to the government s 2 target  Huw Pill says he prefers longer more steady use of interest rates of Table Mountain model over sharp rise and fall of Matterhorn approach|4.0|4.0

104|Rangers stuck on the outside for Uefa s last convoluted 32 team draw  BIG CUP IS ALMOST BACK BABY Having seen off PSV Eindhoven to qualify for the group stages of Big Cup this time last year Rangers had every right to feel bullish about their chances of repeating the feat on Wednesday night While their tie against the Eredivisie side was finely poised after a 2 2 draw at Ibrox any notions Mick Beale s team might have had about getting a result at the Philips Stadion were quickly disabused when their Dutch hosts set about taking them apart with the meticulous efficiency of horologist Steve Fletcher getting stuck into an antique clock on The Repair Shop If anything the 5 1 scoreline seriously flattered Rangers who were long out of the tie when Connor Goldson summed up their performance with a comedy no look own goal past Jack Butland Rangers must now settle for a place in Big Vase which fiscal blow aside is probably the best place for them when you consider the various humiliations visited upon them in last season s Big Cup group stages which they ended with a record of P6 W0 D0 L6 GF2 GA22 For this team this game came far too soon that s what s clear barked Beale who bristled at the suggestion his team had shipped a hiding despite all available evidence to the contrary It s bitterly disappointing we are out of Big Cup I think we played against an excellent team But just an apology to our fans who came across They stuck with the team in both legs and they expect a bit more than what they got One suspects they will certainly be expecting more than what

t turn up thus denying himself the in appreciation gift of a gold plated Ronson table lighter I was brought on as substitute So the local lad got the lighter which took pride of place on the mantelpiece and my proud granny took on dusting and polishing duties with great ceremony When she passed my mother took a shift with Mr Sheen I got married moved to Yorkshire and we persuaded Denis to come too Later still my wife continued the duty of care all the way to Sydney where the sea air took its toll on Denis especially since it was many decades since anyone in the household smoked My wife

105|Rachmaninov The Piano Concertos Paganini Rhapsody review glittering interpretation holds its own The most popular piano concertos of the 20th century have never been short of outstanding interpreters and the recorded history of Rachmaninov s four concertos together with the even more successful Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini is a hugely distinguished one From the composer s own recordings in the 1930s to Daniil Trifonov s cycle completed in 2019 there s no shortage of excellent complete surveys as well as dazzling performances of individual concertos such as Sviatoslav Richter s account of the Second Vladimir Horowitz or Martha Argerich s performances of the Third or Arturo Benedetti Michelangeli s unsurpassed version of the Fourth So Yuja Wang faces some fierce competition in her survey of the five works which is taken from concerts in Los Angeles s Walt Disney Hall last February It followed a series of performances of the concertos that Wang had given in North America including an extraordinary marathon in New York s Carnegie Hall in which she played all five works in a single day with Yannick Nezet S guin and the Philadelphia Orchestra These performances with Gustavo Dudamel and the Los Angeles Philharmonic were spread more sensibly across a fortnight with one concerto in each concert Wang has recorded three of the works before the second concerto and the Rhapsody with Claudio Abbado and the Third with Dudamel in 2011 and 2013 respectively But however dazzling those performances are technically she is a much more mature performer nowadays While the flashy exuberance of the First Concerto and its quicksilver changes of mood suit both her and the slick reactions of Dudamel and his orchestra down to the ground she equally teases out the lyricism of the Andante with great sensitivity The famous opening chords of the Second are presented in a way that seems to prepare for a great drama not just romantic indulgence yet the slow movement seems a little brisk and prosaic Other pianists find more depth there though few dispatch the finale with quite the elan that Wang commands Stream it on Apple Music above or on Spotify The performance of the third concerto the most complex and ambiguous of the four is also the hardest to pin down the opening theme lacks the sense of mystery and inwardness that some bring to it though against that the tracery of the second theme is beautifully shaped just as the slow movement is full of exquisite detail For all its energy too the Fourth is a little uneven the rapport between orchestra and soloist not as convincing as elsewhere while the Rhapsody glitters as it should even if Wang does milk the music s lyrical moments a bit too much particularly in the famous 18th variation But perhaps no single pianist s view of these works will ever be consistently convincing picking and choosing between different interpreters for each concerto is still the way to go  Yuja Wang s interpretation of the concertos is more mature than her previous work carrying off flashy exuberance and changes of mood with dramatic flair|18.0|18.0
106|El Conde review Pablo Larra n s horror satire pitches Pinochet as a vampire The undead forces of fascism swoop vampirically through our 21st century global twilight the fascists once covertly supported by the western powers as a bulwark against communism and now proclaiming themselves as a vital bulwark against Islamism wokeism etc Chilean director Pablo Larra n concerns himself with this international fascism and some fascism closer to home in his boisterously macabre ultraviolent single note horror satire El Conde or The Count It s entertaining in a Spitting Image way if endowed with a certain willed political naivety shot almost entirely in sepulchral black and white powerful at the beginning and end and sagging in the middle Larra n s earlier movies such as Post Mortem No and The Club are variously about how the gruesome dictator Augusto Pinochet lives on and on in Chile past his retirement in 1990 and his death in 2006 as so many of Chile s prosperous classes continue to struggle with their memories of how they did well under his rule Now Larra n turns this idea into a gothic reality by turning Pinochet Jaime Vadell an 250 year old vampire who came of age as a reactionary bloodsucker in the French military during the Revolution obsessively loyal to Marie Antoinette whose head he loots from her grave and carries with him in his personal effects He drifts across Europe and as Dracula wound up in Yorkshire Pinochet arrived in Santiago Chile joined its army and rose to grisly prominence in the 1973 coup whose 50 year anniversary this movie avowedly marks He fakes his own death there is a great moment when the corpse s eyes flicker open during the lying in state and continues to slake his thirst covertly drifting drone like above the teeming city streets ready to pounce But now he is bored on the point of starving himself of sanguinary nourishments and finally ending it all But first he must settle up with his retinue his ageing cantankerous wife Gloria M nchmeyer and bickering mediocre grownup children and his butler a chillingly reactionary White Russian veteran Fyodor played by the excellent Alfredo Castro who I was half expecting to play Pinochet himself At any rate he has some chilling dialogue sequences with his master as they discuss how much they adored torturing dissidents and looting from the state These dependents have also agreed to a forensic inspection of the general s papers to identify where he has hidden his looted millions so they can get hold of it and this accountant is also very bizarrely a nun played by Paula Luchsinger who intends to exorcise him and purify his legacy just as the Church is arguably doing with Pinochet in the real world The most showstopping supporting turn is one that is at first only given to us in voiceover the narrative commentary from Pinochet s biggest ever fan It would be unsporting to give away the identity of the undead speaker though you ll recognise who it is at once But how about all those other vampires who helped the vampire Chilean general to power in 1973 Surely the tomb door will grind open to reveal the black cloaked and fanged figure of Henry Kissinger still with us as I write at the age of 100 Richard Nixon CIA chief Vernon Walters No It s just our narrator although Madame Pinochet has a mug with Queen Elizabeth II on it Well a gothic fantasy about vampires is not the same as a documentary although veterans of the 1973 coup may feel the film has missed out Americans in favour of more obvious targets Having said this the reductionism of this crazed alt history mythology has a lot of graphic novel energy and directness which the whole clotted central section about the butler and accountant nun doesn t quite And the use of Vivaldi s Four Seasons on the soundtrack is a bit route one But this is another powerful addition to Larra n s movies about the ongoing agony of Chile and the Chilean people s struggle to confront the past armed with the hammer and the sharpened stake El Conde screened at the Venice film festival it is released in UK cinemas on 8 September and on Netflix on 15 September  Macabre alt history faces the ongoing agony of Chile and the Chilean people s struggle to confront their past with graphic novel energy and directness|16.0|12.0
107|English schools told to close buildings made with crumble risk concrete More than 100 schools are facing the immediate closure of buildings constructed from potentially dangerous aerated concrete panels plunging the beginning of term into chaos for thousands of pupils The government has found that 156 schools in England have reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete RAAC materials but only 52 have put mitigations in place against risks including collapse it admitted on Thursday Engineers have warned the material is at risk of cracking and spalling and of shear failure The Department for Education DfE has told schools to immediately shut buildings made with aerated concrete until safety work is undertaken Official communications seen by the Guardian acknowledge that this may come as a shock and is likely to cause disruption but say the safety of pupils students and staff is our priority In an escalation of the schools building safety crisis the DfE has issued new advice believed to have happened as recently as Thursday stating that regardless of the assessed risk of a building made using reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete RAAC blocks such buildings should be taken out of use and mitigations should be implemented immediately The department is understood to be planning to make a statement imminently and education unions said they had been told a formal announcement was due on Thursday afternoon The Guardian revealed on Wednesday that officials were making hurried calls urging school leaders to draw up contingency plans for buildings at risk of collapse because of crumbling concrete Now schools are being told to take buildings out of use straight away in what appears to be a response to advice to proceed with greater caution Schools are being told that the government will help them implement contingency plans quickly to keep disruption to face to face education to an absolute minimum Decaying aerated concrete had been found in 65 schools in England after nearly 200 completed surveys with 24 requiring emergency action according to a report by the National Audit Office The number of schools at risk is expected to increase when the results of surveys of 572 schools with suspected RAAC are published by the DfE Four schools were shut in April and June after RAAC was discovered in their buildings On Wednesday a DfE spokesperson said We have been engaging with schools and responsible bodies about the potential risks of RAAC since 2018 and subsequently published guidance on identifying and managing it The Association of School and College Leaders said the rush to establish contingency plans in case buildings collapse was symptomatic of the government s neglect of the school estate The shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson said it was a staggering display of Tory incompetence Dozens of England s schools are at risk of collapse with just days before children crowd their corridors she said Ministers have been content to let this chaos continue for far too long Paul Whiteman the general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers said the union had repeatedly raised concerns about the dangers and while this news is shocking sadly it is not hugely surprising He said it was the result of a decade of swingeing cuts to spending on school buildings The government is right to put the safety of pupils and staff first but the timing of this couldn t be worse with children due to return from the summer holidays next week This will put school leaders under tremendous pressure as they have to scramble to organise alternative accommodation Unison which represents more than 200 000 non academic school staff said the situation was nothing short of a scandal The DfE and government have squandered valuable months hiding this crisis when they should have been fixing dangerous school buildings said its head of education Mike Short A DfE script that appears to be for use by officials contacted by potentially affected schools states As RAAC has been identified in your school college nursery we are recommending you vacate all the areas with confirmed RAAC even if they are assessed as non critical unless mitigations are already in place It asks school leaders to confirm if propping failsafing or strengthening works have been undertaken how many affected spaces have undergone mitigations and whether the school can fit pupils into spaces that are unaffected With just days to go before next week s start of term it tells them Ahead of the start of term you should plan to take any RAAC affected space that do not have mitigations out of use and timetable accordingly The Institution of Structural Engineers this year warned that cracking and spalling were risks in roof and floor panels made from the aerated concrete products that were often installed from the 1960s to the 1980s Many roof panels have been installed with insufficient bearing on structural supports resulting in a significant risk to the material s integrity including shear failure Some panels have become saturated by water ingress making them heavier than they were designed to be It said to fix the buildings it may be appropriate to apply remedial action only to the affected panels but this may be applied to all panels within the building being assessed In 2010 a long planned 55bn schools rebuilding programme Building Schools for the Future was scrapped by the then education secretary Michael Gove during the first months of the coalition government He has since said he regretted the decision The Liberal Dem0crat education spokesperson Munira Wilson said This shocking admission is a concrete result of years of Conservative neglect of our school buildings Parents teachers and pupils will be horrified that children have been taught in unsafe buildings and cannot return to school next week Instead pupils face more misery learning in temporary classrooms or being bussed miles to local schools Pupil safety is paramount but for this to come out just days before term starts is totally unacceptable  A week before start of term DfE says buildings should be taken out of use regardless of assessed risk|1.0|19.0
108|Bank of England must see job through on cost of living eurozone inflation higher than expected as it happened Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill wants a Table Mountain shape to UK interest rates Pill contrasted higher for longer rates with the short sharp peak of Switzerland s Matterhorn In the US a quicker turnaround in interest rate policy may be appropriate given diminishing inflationary pressures according to the reading of Ian Shepherdson chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics a consultancy He said The bigger picture here is that it is becoming harder to dismiss the improvement in the inflation numbers as mere noise Our base case is that the year over year increase in the core PCE will fall to around 3 by the end of the year setting the stage for rate cuts starting next spring But there are still other indicators that could push the Fed to hike further argues Ryan Brandham head of global capital markets North America at Validus Risk Management an investment software company He picked up on weekly jobs data which came in better than expected 228 000 new jobs were created compared to an expected 235 000 He said While the US economy may be slowing the labour market is showing signs of resilience The Fed will need to determine whether they should take actions to weaken the labour market in order to get inflation down to 2 or if the recent slowing is enough to feel confident that inflation is under control There is data still to come ahead of the September Fed meeting but this result indicates another hike this year may still be on the cards The eurozone inflation upside surprise also offers a problem for central bankers Charles Hepworth investment director GAM Investments an asset manager said Just when everyone assumed eurozone inflation was going to continue its downward trajectory data published today showed the consumer price index remained stuck at 5 3 over the year Meanwhile core inflation also stayed at the same level This presents somewhat of a problem for the ECB when it meets in two weeks to decide interest rate policy A 0 25 hike is most likely on the cards after this data print which will take the deposit facility rate to 4 In other business news Job cuts at Wilko s head office and warehouses are to begin on Monday after a surprise 90m bid for the discount retailer fell through Marks amp

reading today on the official last day of summer Join us tomorrow for the sequel autumn JJ Slower inflation is making some people predict the Federal Reserve can engineer the much hoped for soft landing bringing down inflation while avoiding a recession Consumer spending in the US increased in July by 0 8 but inflation figures came in as expected picking up only slightly Paul Ashworth chief North America economist at Capital Economics a consultancy said Despite the apparent strength of real demand inflationary pressures continued to ease with both the headline and core PCE personal consumption expenditure deflators increasing by 0 2 month on month Unfavourable base effects pushed core PCE inflation back up to 4 2 from 4 1 but the three month annualised rate slowed to a two and a half year low of 2 8 from 3 3 the month before That s still above the 2 target but factoring in the coming slowdown in housing inflation a return to target by mid 2024 is now well within reach The core measure of inflation which strips out more volatile food and energy figures came in at 4 2 up from 4 1 in June the US BEA said The Fed is also fond of the core measure because some policymakers believe it gives a better indication of underlying inflationary pressures the kind of things that central bankers can target rather than external shocks such as surging energy prices The lack of a big negative surprise such as a stronger rise in inflation could give the Federal Reserve room to pause its rate hike path Fed governor Jerome Powell did not give much away about his plans when he spoke about the path of interest rates last week at the annual central bankers summit at Jackson Hole Wyoming But interest rate derivatives markets suggest there is a 90 chance that the Fed will not hike at its next meeting on 20 September NB in the previous post I put the figure for core PCE Please refresh to see the correction US consumer inflation picked up slightly in July but was exactly as expected according to the measure that is known to be favoured by the Federal Reserve The personal consumption expenditures index rose by 3 3 in the year to July the US Bureau of Economic Analysis said That was bang on the consensus expectation from economists polled by Reuters This post has been corrected to include the correct figure The take from Reuters is that today s eurozone data have something for everyone Eurozone inflation proved unexpectedly stubborn this month although price pressures for underlying goods eased providing ammunition for both supporters and opponents of another European Central Bank interest rate hike It reported that Robert Holzmann Austria s central bank chief and one of the most outspoken conservatives on the rate setting governing council told a Reuters conference that he was still leaning towards a hike but did not consider the inflation data a clincher I have not made up a decision because I don t have all the data but I would not exclude that I would go for a hike We are not yet at the highest level for rates it could be that we do another hike or two Ahead of US inflation data here is some analysis of the figures from the eurozone which appeared to show inflation remaining stubbornly high Bert Colijn senior economist for the eurozone at ING a Dutch investment bank said Inflation in the eurozone did not fall in August which could tip the ECB in favour of a final 0 25 percentage point hike at the governing council meeting in two weeks time Still overall inflation dynamics remain relatively benign and we still expect inflation to trend much lower at the end of the year Richard Flax chief investment officer at Moneyfarm a wealth manager said The battle between the hawks and the doves is likely to heat up ahead of the next ECB decision Nine straight rate hikes from the ECB have cooled economic growth and amid concerns over deflationary pressures markets have begun to price in a possible pause to eurozone rate hikes when the ECB meets in September However with inflation data still remaining at elevated levels we cannot rule out further rate hikes before the year is out India s economy grew at an annual pace of 7 8 in the first quarter of 2023 slightly faster than the 7 7 expected by economists It was the fastest growth in a year An update on those 10bn in cost cuts by UBS after taking over its erstwhile rival Credit Suisse the bank will cut 3 000 jobs in Switzerland alone That is one in 12 Swiss jobs a tricky prospect during an election year in the country 8 000 people have already left Credit Suisse of its own accord according to Reuters The name is also due to disappear completely 167 years after it was founded in 1856 The Financial Times also has an interesting tidbit about UBS s results which the bank put out at the same time as the strategy announcement UBS technically recorded the biggest profit of all time for a bank at 29bn 23bn for the quarter Don t get too excited though its record 29bn pre tax profit was almost entirely thanks to the accounting gain it recorded on the 3 4bn takeover the FT reported The previous largest quarterly bank profit was 14 3bn reported by JP Morgan at the start of 2021 Job cuts at Wilko s head office and warehouses are expected to begin this week after a surprise 90m bid for the discount retailer fell through It is understood that about a third of the 1 400

administrators this month as it ran short of cash The UK government has proposed changes to heat pump regulations which it says could make it cheaper and easier for households and small businesses to install the green technology but there may be a catch The proposals could mean varying the levels of grants 5 000 for an air source heat pump or biomass boiler or 6 000 for a ground source heat pump depending on the customer s property type or existing fuel source The changes could make heat pumps more affordable for even more households and small businesses the government said Heat pumps are seen by most experts as one of the most important technologies for the energy transition replacing fossil fuels burned in the home with electricity which can gradually be switched to zero emissions sources However the consultation shows that the government is considering ways to actually cut the grants on offer for some households in the future The consultation said It is possible that heat pump costs will fall faster for properties currently with gas heating rather than those with oil heating If this transpires then it may be appropriate in future to reduce the grant value faster for properties replacing gas heating than oil heating Other changes mean that houses will not have to meet a higher bar for energy performance such as requiring proper insulation to qualify for heat pump subsidies which a Lords committee had found to be a barrier to installation for some people Subsidies could also be available to biomass boilers that can cook as well under the proposals Jess Ralston an energy analyst at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit ECIU a thinktank said it was welcome that the UK government was realising that it is falling behind peers on heat pump installations She said This move would mean the UK s levels of support for installing heat pumps becomes more closely aligned to other nations including lots of EU countries the US and Australia The rest of the world has been slowly ramping up heat pump deployment for some time so much so that there are now 20m installed in Europe and the US sold more heat pumps than gas boilers last year Wise shares listed in London are down by 1 8 after the sanctions announcement They had fallen as far as 4 when the initial announcement came out You can see the share price move in the below chart A big drop followed by a sigh of relief in visual form as investors realised there was no monetary penalty Fintech firm Wise has broken UK laws on sanctions on Russia by allowing a person under sanctions to withdraw cash the Treasury has said Wise escaped a fine because it was only a 250 withdrawal and the company reported the breach itself The nature and circumstances of this breach were assessed as moderately severe the Treasury s Office for Financial Sanctions Implementation OFSI said in a report The appropriate penalty was therefore disclosure consider them punished The withdrawal was from a business account held with Wise but was on a card issued in the designated person s name on 30 June one day after sanctions were imposed on 29 June There were 12 people newly designated for sanctions on 29 June 2022 according to the UK s sanctions list among them Russian oligarchs and leaders of the Wagner mercenary group The person who withdrew the money was not named Wise matched the name on a sanctions database but its policy was not to shut down access to debit cards immediately because of a lot of false positives the Treasury report said Someone checked the sanctions a day after the withdrawal was made and it took another three days for the debit card to be blocked OFSI said Despite the low breach value OFSI considered that Wise s systems and controls specifically its policy surrounding debit card payments were inappropriate This factor made the case moderately severe overall and enabled funds to be made available to a company owned or controlled by the designated person A Wise spokesperson said At Wise we take the responsibility of complying with all sanctions laws very seriously We took immediate steps to suspend our services to Russia as soon as sanctions were enacted in response to its invasion of Ukraine On June 29 2022 an individual was added to the list of sanction designated persons under UK regulations We promptly followed sanctions screening procedures and suspended an account suspected to belong to a business owned by that individual This meant that the account holder could no longer send or receive any funds via this account During our review of this account however we learned that a business debit card associated with the account was used to make a 250 ATM withdrawal on the same day We voluntarily reported this ATM withdrawal to OFSI undertook an immediate review of our processes and implemented the necessary internal system changes to prevent this type of transaction going forward We take this matter very seriously We remain committed to ensuring that our day to day operations are in compliance with all relevant regulatory requirements and to working openly and collaboratively with our regulators This post has been updated to add Wise s comment Bank of England chief economist Huw Pill used some intriguing topographical metaphors in his speech on the UK economy and the path of interest rates Bloomberg s Lucy White reports that Pill said he wanted a Table Mountain approach to interest rates rather than a Matterhorn The speech was in Cape Town which is overlooked by Table Mountain A flat top would suggest interest rates will remain at current levels for a long while rather than dropping steeply like the famous spike of the Matterhorn on the Swiss Italian border And a thumbs up from the business live blog for visually interesting metaphors in central bank speeches The euro has edged further against the US dollar today after eurozone inflation data beat expectations The single currency is trading at 1 087 down 0 5 against the dollar It peaked above 1 093 earlier this morning Eurozone unemployment stayed stable at 6 4 so it is the inflation data that will be the focus for economists Food alcohol and tobacco was the main driver of inflationary pressure Eurostat said Energy prices have fallen markedly although that follows a lot of increases caused by Russia s war in Ukraine Eurostat said Looking at the main components of euro area inflation food alcohol amp tobacco is expected to have the highest annual rate in August 9 8 compared with 10 8 in July followed by services 5 5 compared with 5 6 in July non energy industrial goods 4 8 compared with 5 0 in July and energy 3 3 compared with 6 1 in July Eurozone inflation has come in higher than expected adding to pressure on the European Central Bank to push ahead with another rate hike at its September meeting Inflation across the euro area is expected to come in at 5 3 in August the same as July statistics office Eurostat said Economists had expected inflation to fall to 5 1 according to a poll by Reuters The UK s energy regulator is to ban a controversial practice by electricity generators in which they made tens of millions of pounds a day for helping to balance the grid Energy companies were accused of manipulating the market by saying they were going to switch off their generators just at the moment they were most needed Under the UK s grid balancing system they were then offered inflated prices to turn them back on Regulator Ofgem said it would ban the practice from 26 October in time for this winter s heating season Generators could face stiff penalties for breach of licence conditions including being subject to provisional and final orders and fines of up to 10 of their regulated turnover Ofgem said Eleanor Warburton Ofgem s acting director for energy systems management and security said This new licence conditions shows Ofgem will not tolerate electricity generators attempting to take advantage of the balancing mechanism system to make excessive profits through inflexible generation We believe the new licence condition strikes the right balance between protecting consumers and ensuring they pay a fair price for their energy while also enabling a competitive electricity market that provides fair returns for generators We ll be monitoring the effectiveness of it to ensure it s doing what it was designed to do Ofgem had said it was considering changes to the regime in March The scale of the profits made from the balancing regime was enormous Balancing costs paid ultimately by the taxpayer tripled in the winter of 2021 22 to over 1 5bn between November 2021 and February 2022 compared to average annual winter balancing costs of just under 500m for between 2017 and 2020 Ofgem said The Bank of England s Huw Pill also cautioned that there was a risk that the central bank raises borrowing costs too high He said Now that policy is in restrictive territory there is the possibility of doing too much and inflicting unnecessary damage on employment and growth But he also said there was no room for complacency Reuters reported Some indicators of underlying inflation pressures have developed less benignly recently than the headline rate of inflation Headline UK inflation has fallen from 11 1 in October a 40 year high to 6 8 in July The Bank of England needs to keep interest rates high enough for long enough to see the job through on cutting inflation its chief economist has said Huw Pill said he was focused on a lasting return to target for UK inflation which was at 6 8 in July well above the Bank s 2 target The Bank s monetary policy committee MPC has raised interest rates for 14 times in a row and has another meeting on 21 September It is expected to raise rates further Speaking at a research conference in Cape Town organised by the South African Reserve Bank Pill said via Reuters The key element is that we on the MPC need to see the job through and ensure a lasting and sustainable return of inflation to the 2 target At present the emphasis is still on ensuring that we are in the words of the MPC s last statement sufficiently restrictive for sufficiently long to ensure that we have that lasting return to target Germany s unemployment rate has risen slightly as expected to 5 7 That s up from 5 6 in July according Germany s federal statistics office Shares in Swiss bank UBS have jumped by 7 after it said it was hoping to make 10bn 7 9bn in cost cuts after absorbing rival Credit Suisse s domestic bank operations Taking over those operations rather than selling them off or floating it separately could be politically difficult because of likely job losses in Switzerland Nevertheless investors appear to like what they see in UBS s first results since the takeover Its share price is now higher than at any time since the financial crisis in October 2008 Credit Suisse was sunk not by its domestic operations but rather by a series of huge errors by its corporate and investment bank UBS stepped in to rescue it at the behest of the Swiss government after it became clear Credit Suisse would not make its way out of a crisis Sergio Ermotti UBS s chief executive said Our analysis clearly shows that full integration is the best outcome for UBS our stakeholders and the Swiss economy Clients will continue to receive the premium level of service they expect benefiting from enhanced offerings expert capabilities and global reach And Credit Suisse will continue to sponsor civic sporting and cultural activities in Switzerland at least until the end of 2025 Are we heading for a Eurozone inflation surprise in a few hours French inflation has come in higher than analysts expectations French consumer prices rose by 5 7 in August compared to a year earlier up from 5 1 in July according to data harmonised with the rest of the EU published by Insee France s statistics office That was higher than the 5 4 expected by economists polled by Reuters Insee said This increase in inflation is due to a rebound in energy prices The prices of food slowed down for the fifth consecutive month as did to a lesser extent those of manufactured goods and services The FTSE 100 has dipped at the opening bell The UK s blue chip index is down 0 1 with mining company Glencore the biggest faller down 5 Glencore is the subject of a story by the Financial

the FT Good morning and welcome to our live coverage of business economics and financial markets UK car production rose year on year for the sixth consecutive month in July as the global chip shortage eased and the numbers of electric cars and hybrids rose Production from UK factories rose by 31 6 in July compared to last year according to new data from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders SMMT Output remains 29 below 2019 before the coronavirus pandemic although that includes the effect of Honda s closure of a plant in Swindon More than eight in 10 cars made in the UK were shipped overseas The top destination market as ever was the EU followed by the US China Japan and Australia Almost two in every five cars were electric or were hybrids combining batteries with petrol or diesel engines Electrified volumes rose 73 9 to 30 180 So far this year 200 000 of the UK s 527 000 cars have been electrified in some way although the SMMT does not break down how many are pure electric in its announcement Mike Hawes SMMT chief executive said Six months of growth shows that British car production is recovering and with electrified models increasingly driving volumes the future is more positive Recent investment announcements have undoubtedly bolstered the sector but global competition remains tough If we are to attract further investment and produce the next generation of zero emission models and technologies we need a coherent strategy that builds on our strengths and supports all aspects of advanced automotive manufacturing Today s big focus in financial markets will be on inflation data with key measures ahead from the eurozone and the US today Both the European Central Bank and the US Federal Reserve will be watching the data closely for signs that inflationary pressures are easing They must decide whether to raise interest rates further to make sure inflation stays lower or whether they have now done enough Jim Reid and other

109|Seven new walking leaf insect species discovered Seven new leaf insect species known as walking leaves have been discovered The insects exhibit a sophisticated twigs and leaf like camouflage allowing them to blend into their surroundings without detection posing a challenge to both predators and researchers Historically taxonomy the sorting and classification of species has been difficult with insects that cannot be identified based on external appearance alone The new study published in the journal ZooKeys used genetic analysis to identify the species Some insects found in India had previously been assumed to be part of a larger south east Asian species group Individuals of different species are often counted as belonging to the same species based on their appearance We were only able to identify some of the new species by their genetic characteristics explained lead researcher Dr Sarah Bank Aubin of the University of G ttingen in Germany Co author Dr Sven Bradler also at the University of G ttingen added There are around 3 500 known species of stick and leaf insects and there are currently just over 100 described species of leaf insect Although they only make up a small fraction of this diverse family of insects their spectacular and unexpected appearance makes them unique The findings are important not only for the systematic study of leaf insects but also for the protection of their diversity The loss of these Indian insects would not merely reduce numbers within a known species it would mean the extinction of an entirely separate species Bank Aubin emphasised the importance of biodiversity preservation The finding is important for species conservation if all the individuals die out in India it is not just a group within a species that is reduced as was previously thought In fact a whole distinct species is being wiped out This means that the Indian species is particularly important to protect Using these genetic techniques more than 20 new cryptic species have been discovered from Vietnam Borneo Java and the Philippines  Researchers used genetic analysis to identify species that cannot be distinguished by appearance alone|1.0|8.0
110|Where Winds Meet is China s answer to Assassin s Creed Assassin s Creed and Total War have proven that video games can be better than any tattered textbook at bringing history alive though they do tend to retread the same old battlegrounds of western Europe China s Everstone Studio is hoping to change that letting players loose on an open world 10th century China in its debut game Where Winds Meet Here we are put into the sandals of a nameless young martial artist and transported back to the dramatic fall of the Southern Tang dynasty where the sudden poisoning of Emperor Li Yu thrusts our hero into a dangerous new world Despite its indie origins Where Winds Meet looks like a game with a big budget behind it drawing comparisons to Sucker Punch s multimillion dollar samurai epic Ghosts of Tsushima Its sprawling depiction of southern China is a sight to behold comb through the gameplay videos and you ll see its hero roaming across a luscious countryside one minute stumbling upon a serene wildlife filled pond the next and then being pursued by bandits after dark dodging arrows on rain soaked rooftops Where Japanese made series such as Dynasty Warriors have had players happily cleaving their way across China s third century Three Kingdom era since the days of the PS2 Where Winds Meets dials the clock forward exploring a far more chaotic and uncertain chapter of Chinese history Our goal was to offer something different say Everstone who prefer to be quoted as a collective The Five Dynasties and 10 Kingdoms period in Chinese history is an extraordinary era characterised by disorder even surpassing the turbulence of the Three Kingdoms era As creators we find this period fascinating Where Winds Meets is heavily influenced by Wuxia cinema the genre popularised by Ang Lee s Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon Combining history with a healthy dose of mythology players can expect to hear philosophical musings from ancient Chinese poets wrestle wild bears and master an ancient strand of kung fu by carefully observing a bathing frog Where Winds Meet encompasses both realistic combat moves and elements that defy physical laws filled with romantic imagination Everstone say We are striving to replicate various unique weapons from eastern martial arts such as spears swords fans dual swords umbrellas and long knives Where the aforementioned multimillion selling Ghost of Tsushima was a 13th century Japan set epic made by a firmly American studio Where Winds Meets deals with the culture and history of its studios own homeland When it comes to depicting kung fu especially the team has gone to great lengths to do it justice We pay great attention to the portrayal of martial arts the team says There are many fascinating kung fu designs such as Xing Yi Quan which originated from the simulation of animal hunting behaviour and Fei Yan Zou Bi which translates to flying over eaves and walking on walls enabling swift traversal over obstacles This kind of kung fu has appeared before in martial arts literature and films but this fusion isn t merely about combining martial arts themes with an open world game setting it involves a genuine interweaving of these elements to the extent that removing either component would render the experience incomplete The collision and integration of these eastern martial arts abilities this is what sets us apart from other open world games In an intriguing touch outside the blood spattered main storyline Everstone promises that players will be free to ignore their heroic quest in order to take up more unconventional roles You can hone your gift of the gab to become an entrancing orator study medicine and roleplaying as a doctor or lay down your sword to learn construction or commerce bringing a life simulation flavour to this historical epic Where Winds Meet s ambition is commendable at a time when spiralling production costs are leading many studios to produce increasingly safe and conservative open world games that feel the same despite their different settings Its developers are delving into their heritage to create something distinct Where Winds Meet will be released on PC in 2024  Everstone s debut video game hopes to do for 10th century China what Ubisoft s open world series did for ancient Greece and renaissance Italy|11.0|29.0
111|Scientists demand end to dingo baiting after research reveals most are genetically pure Scientists are calling on governments to end baiting programs targeting dingoes in national parks to ditch the inappropriate and misleading term wild dog and to proactively engage with Indigenous Australians regarding dingo management Dozens of scientists have written to the New South Wales Victorian and South Australian environment and agriculture ministers to push for changes to dingo policies in light of new scientific research Dr Kylie Cairns a conservation biologist at the University of New South Wales and a key signatory of the letters said government policy was out of step with the latest research on dingoes in Australia A study she led published in May found that most canids in Australia are pure dingoes and that dingo dog hybridisation is rare Dingoes are classified as native species in all jurisdictions on the Australian mainland It s just not acceptable for a native species to be killed in the manner that we re doing in national parks and that is happening pretty much all across the country Cairns said There is no other native animal that is managed the way dingoes are in Australia The letter to the NSW government details extensive lethal control activities including aerial baiting ground baiting aerial shooting ground shooting and trapping being carried out across national parks and conservation areas for the management of wild dogs A lot of people think that dingoes are different from wild dogs when the government use of the term includes dingoes Cairns said The terminology wild dogs has been adopted because of concern that there s a lot of hybridisation going on in populations But the science is now saying we don t actually have that many of those mixed animals there are basically no feral dogs and there are very few hybrids that have very little dingo ancestry We need to change the terminology so that it s clear and transparent what animals are being targeted for lethal control in different areas and also so that we can have a more open discussion about how we re going to balance the protection of a native species with managing them in places where they may be causing issues for agriculture Sign up for Guardian Australia s free morning and afternoon email newsletters for your daily news roundup In Victoria dingoes are a listed threatened species but there are baiting and trapping programs for wild dogs Dingoes are not protected on private land and some public land within 3km of a private boundary It s quite frankly absurd that within Victoria one arm of government recognises and protects the dingo as a listed threatened species and another is actively promoting and funding their destruction through schemes such as the misleadingly named wild dog bounty said Euan Ritchie a professor in wildlife ecology and conservation at Deakin University and one of the letters signatories In Victoria now outdated methods had suggested that pure dingoes made up as little as 4 18 of the dingo population However newer analysis has found that 87 1 of animals are pure Where these native apex predators are more common and abundant there are typically far fewer or no feral goats and smaller populations of kangaroos wallabies and emus and in some cases feral pigs too Ritchie said Dingoes can also kill and deter foxes and feral cats Overall this reduces overgrazing of vegetation as well as the predation of smaller native animals helping to maintain healthier ecosystems and conserve biodiversity While dingoes can pose a risk to livestock we must also recognise the risk that their ongoing persecution represents both ecologically and culturally especially for many First Nations peoples The letters come as people of the Wotjobaluk Nations in Victoria have called on the state government to stop all measures that result in the killing and persecution of dingoes We the people of the Wotjobaluk Nations have had an immensely strong cultural and spiritual connection to wilkerr dingo for thousands of years and it is part of our living cultural heritage they said a statement endorsed at a cultural gathering event in June Don t wait until it is too late and they disappear through your neglect We do not give you permission to kill wilkerr and we never did  Discovery that most canids in Australia are not hybrids with wild dogs leads researchers to push to change policy and terminology|24.0|8.0
112|Goodbye The Great a sad farewell to one of TV s best shows It seems that not even an A list cast multiple Emmy nominations and rave reviews are enough to save a television series in this era of cancellations and culls After the unsurprising news that The Idol has been axed the mildly surprising news that Disney s 20 000 Leagues Under the Sea prequel Nautilus will not be released at all and the disheartening news that A League Of Their Own will not get its promised ending comes the genuinely eyebrow raising announcement that The Great has been cancelled by Hulu after three magnificently extroverted huzzah soaked seasons The Great is one of the most enjoyable shows on television Created by Tony McNamara who co wrote The Favourite it follows Elle Fanning s Catherine from the naive beginnings of her marriage to Peter III grandson of Peter the Great to her emergence as a key figure in the Enlightenment and rise to Empress of All Russia in her own right This doesn t necessarily sound like the stuff of comedy greatness but war addled Russia in the 18th century proved to be surprisingly fertile ground for rambunctious dark humour Nicholas Hoult co stars as the simple violent idiotic yet striving Peter who underestimates his young wife before falling for her completely all the while locked in a hostile battle of the wills with her They love each other they hate each other they try to kill each other they have a baby to a loud backdrop of smashed plates and blasting cannons It makes that Christmas episode of The Bear look like Couples Therapy There are plenty of historical series that aim to grab the attention of a modern audiences with an anachronistic approach playing loose with the facts throwing in nods to the future and using contemporary language and music But even when setting a crucial moment to say AC DC The Great stood out amongst its peers It pushed further with a more voracious appetite It was one of those rare shows in which it proved largely impossible to guess what might happen next Most screenwriting for television and film is formulaic and if you watch enough of it you anticipate the rise and fall of the story the part where one character is about to face their biggest fear the part where everything falls away only to be returned with great fanfare and triumph The Great was never predictable as it proved again and again by killing off central characters with barely a moment s notice Absolutely nobody was safe from a bullet a bear or an icy lake Characters would be pivotal one minute gone the next Even the status of the actor was no guarantee that they d stick around for more than a brief guest arc Its audaciousness was all encompassing There was sex and plenty of it murder and plenty of it betrayals galore all over the place as loyalties waxed and waned It was gory and greedy and all the while it snuck in big ideas about class education politics nationalism and faith It felt ambitious and daring and brash in a way that television is rarely allowed to be When much loved series are cancelled and there is a chorus of online outrage the cold truth is that there is usually a reason for it even if fans are loth to see the deadwood for the trees Trying to work out the popularity of a show on a streaming service is an uphill battle and viewing figures are often obscure but I would hazard a guess that for the most part shows get cancelled because there simply aren t enough people watching them Usually that s because as much as the ardent fans may love them they re too cult or too niche or just not very good But this is not true of The Great which is what makes its cancellation a shock It had great writing great acting and was extremely good looking Perhaps it was too expensive to make its costumes and sets certainly appeared to be appropriately lavish Perhaps not enough people could be won over by the promise that the court of the Empress of All Russia in the 1760s could be a hotbed of sex murder and fabulous silliness Perhaps the extravagance of its tonal shifts from sincerity to satire and back in a single scene made it a hard sell But I am not convinced that these are good reasons At least the end of season three felt like a proper conclusive ending and it did not have to fully address a world in which Catherine s principal sparring partner was no longer part of the show Fans of McNamara s work will get to see more of what he can do soon in Yorgos Lanthimos s delayed Poor Things But for all of the recent TV cancellations I think television will seem less creative and inventive now that The Great has gone This article was amended on 31 August 2023 Catherine the Great was married to Peter III and not his grandfather Peter the Great as an earlier version said  The surprise cancellation of the anachronistic period comedy series is the latest example of a show taken from us too soon|7.0|7.0

114|Grant Shapps great political survivor and reliable Tory attack dog Grant Shapps has proved a vital problem solver to Conservative leaders he has served under and a feared troublemaker to those who left him out in the cold A versatile minister he was privately described by Liz Truss as one of the most competent secretaries of state and probably the best communicator in government But when he was not included in her cabinet when she became prime minister Shapps helped bring Truss down He was behind a similar putsch during Theresa May s premiership Sunak has sought to build a team of unflashy pragmatic and competent ministers However his appointment of Shapps suggests the prime minister realises he needs to focus more on punching back at the Conservatives waning electoral fortunes Shapps a trusted media performer has often been sent out on the airwaves at the last minute to defend sticky situations the government has found itself in He is relatively popular within the party and also one of the most exuberant attack dogs willing to take the fight to Labour But Tory MPs are already raising questions about his suitability for such an important job After all it is often said the first priority of the government is the defence and security of the country Shapps has served in cabinet for many years but solely in domestic briefs Most recently he was the energy security and net zero secretary and briefly when Truss sought unsuccessfully to shore up her doomed premiership home secretary Before that he served as transport secretary and the Conservative party chair Although he has now held five posts in 12 months some people are already questioning why he was picked for defence secretary given there were ample other contenders with more relevant experience Shapps has managed to climb back up the rungs of government after two dramatic falls from grace Born in Hertfordshire in 1968 Shapps studied business and finance at Manchester Metropolitan University In 2001 he made an unsuccessful run to become MP for Welwyn Hatfield before a successful attempt four years later A literal high flyer he holds a pilot s licence he was given a job as communities minister in the first Tory led government under David Cameron and was later party chair But he was catapulted from the cabinet in 2015 after a row over bullying of Tory activists Shapps maintained he had not been warned about the issue before the death of an activist but tendered his resignation on the grounds that responsibility should rest somewhere He has had a chequered CV Shapps was accused of possibly breaching the code of conduct for ministers and MPs when it was revealed he had held a second job after entering parliament something he had repeatedly denied To be absolutely clear I don t have a second job and I have never had a second job whilst being an MP End of story Shapps said to LBC at the time But a recording from 2006 obtained by the Guardian revealed the MP selling a business self help guide Stinking Rich 3 and claiming his products could make listeners a ton of cash by Christmas He later came clean saying he had over firmly denied having a second job and admitted to the BBC he had screwed up on dates Shapps was later exposed as having continued working as a marketer of get rich quick schemes under the pseudonym Michael Green He had established a web sales business HowToCorp which claimed that clients who spent 200 on its software could make 20 000 in 20 days guaranteed or your money back It also emerged he had deleted information from his Wikipedia page such as the names of donors to his private office including a peculiar edit to omit a reference to his studies at Watford grammar school for boys Shapps has made a name for himself in Tory circles as popular and attuned to the grassroots and made himself an indispensable political ally with meticulous spreadsheets used to monitor MPs gripes about the government of the day Prime ministers have learned it is safer to have him inside the tent than out He is a keen TikToker putting him at odds with the government s stance banning the use of the video service on official devices Shapps is a cousin of Mick Jones the lead guitarist of the Clash In appointing Shapps one of the great political survivors of the past 13 years Sunak hopes the minister will help him on the Tories ever narrower path to victory at the next election  New defence secretary is a trusted performer who PMs have learned is safer inside the tent than out|3.0|3.0
115|Top issues in Grant Shapps in tray as new UK defence secretary Grant Shapps appointment comes at a time of the largest war in Europe since 1945 with Britain a key strategic partner for Ukraine as it seeks to kick out the Russian invaders A central part of the job is public and private diplomacy with the UK particularly keen to maintain its position as a bridge between Kyiv always seeking new weapons and an often cautious White House already increasingly mindful of the looming 2024 election battle most likely with Donald Trump Once Boris Johnson had been ousted from Downing Street Kyiv looked to Wallace as an increasingly important figure with the former defence secretary central in efforts to find a pathway for Ukraine to eventually join Nato and in ensuring long term military support continues Shapps will want to keep the long term door to Nato membership open but he may give Kyiv candid advice and help it temper its not always realistic lobbying Top of Kyiv s current wishlist are Atacms ground launched missiles which have a range of 190 miles 300km and have still not been released by the US Shapps may be called upon to try to release them from Washington s grip Over the next year there will also likely be pressure for more artillery tanks and fighter jets although Wallace was careful to warn Ukraine at the Nato summit in July not always to keep pleading for new arms but instead sometimes show a bit of gratitude The new minister also inherits a military badly wanting a government to commit to greater investment in response to the war and dealing with new threats that have emerged such as air and missile defence or drones Russia s attack on Ukraine has highlighted the vulnerability of the electricity grid to missile and drone strikes in a conflict for instance and the military s default response will be to try to spend more money Defence budgets are largely set but Shapps will have to decide in the run up to an election whether he wants the prime minister Rishi Sunak to commit to a firm timetable lifting defence spending from 2 1 of GDP to 2 5 as some European militaries most notably Poland boost their own budgets Boris Johnson had previously promised to increase spending to 2 5 by 2030 but mindful of other spending pressures and the military s long track record of financial waste Sunak has been vague on timing Other threats loom in the background which can easily be talked up by the security community but nevertheless have to be dealt with Chief among these are the issues raised by the rise of China a subject of near obsession in Washington where Beijing is seen as the pacing challenge to justify extra US military spending No change is expected to Britain s Indo Pacific tilt and growing military focus on the region despite its distance from the UK But the defence secretary has to manage the initial development of strategic Aukus nuclear submarine deal which will see the US and UK help Australia build its own nuclear powered attack submarines based largely on a British design Although the Australian submarines intended as a counter to Beijing s fast growing navy will not sail until from the 2040s the project is critical to securing jobs at BAE in Barrow in Furness and Rolls Royce in Derby and needs to be kept on financial and political track in the run up to the general election Shapps will also have to contend with the legacy of Britain s long interventions in Iraq and in particular Afghanistan amid allegations of war crimes committed by the SAS in the country in the early part of the last decade Hearings at a public inquiry into the issue are expected to start in the autumn While the investigation will take some time Shapps will have to engage with public fallout from the issue which some of his predecessors have tried and failed to brush under the carpet Finally there is always the unknown or unexpected crisis Shapps may have to respond calmly and flexibly to incidents in hot spots such as the Middle East or the Gulf where there may be an attack by Islamists or a threat to commercial or maritime interests In the first instance a defence secretary has powers to authorise the use of force or adopt an alternative response Like all his predecessors it will be necessary for him to keep a cool head when faced with an unexpected incident  Ben Wallace s successor faces major issues on several fronts including Ukraine and a British military seeking more investment|16.0|3.0
